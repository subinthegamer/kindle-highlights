In politics, liberalism believes that the voter knows best. It therefore upholds democratic elections. In economics, liberalism maintains that the customer is always right. It therefore hails free-market principles. In personal matters, liberalism encourages people to listen to themselves, be true to themselves, and follow their hearts – as long as they do not infringe on the liberties of others. This personal freedom is enshrined in human rights

Thus when Britain needed to decide whether it should leave the EU, Prime Minister David Cameron didn’t ask Queen Elizabeth II, the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Oxford and Cambridge dons to resolve the issue. He didn’t even ask the Members of Parliament. Rather, he held a referendum in which each and every Briton was asked: ‘What do you feel about it?’

If democracy were a matter of rational decision-making, there would be absolutely no reason to give all people equal voting rights – or perhaps any voting rights. There is ample evidence that some people are far more knowledgeable and rational than others, certainly when it comes to specific economic and political questions.

For we are now at the confluence of two immense revolutions. On the one hand biologists are deciphering the mysteries of the human body, and in particular, of the brain and of human feelings. At the same time computer scientists are giving us unprecedented data-processing power. When the biotech revolution merges with the infotech revolution, it will produce Big Data algorithms that can monitor and understand my feelings much better than I can, and then authority will probably shift from humans to computers

But by 2050, thanks to biometric sensors and Big Data algorithms, diseases may be diagnosed and treated long before they lead to pain or disability. As a result, you will always find yourself suffering from some ‘medical condition’ and following this or that algorithmic recommendation.

It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the “right” thing a long time ago. You really care about having studied the foundations, so you’re not scared of any book. If you go to the library and there’s a book you cannot understand, you have to dig down and say, “What is the foundation required for me to learn this?” Foundations are super important

Basic arithmetic and numeracy are way more important in life than doing calculus. Similarly, being able to convey yourself simply using ordinary English words is far more important than being able to write poetry, having an extensive vocabulary, or speaking seven different foreign languages.

I love working with Elad because I know when the deal is being done, he will bend over backward to give me extra. He will always round off in my favor if there’s an extra dollar being delivered here or there. If there’s some cost to pay, he will pay it out of his own pocket, and he won’t even mention it to me. Because he goes so far out of his way to treat me so well, I send him every deal I have—I try to include him in everything. Then, I go out of my way to try and pay for him. Compounding in those relationships is very valuable.

You can learn from anything. But for example, when you go back to school, 99 percent of the term papers you did, books you read, exercises you did, things you learned, they don’t really apply. You might have read geography and history you never reuse. You might have studied a language you don’t speak anymore. You might have studied a branch of mathematics you completely forgot. Of course, these are learning experiences. You did learn. You learned the value of hard work; you might have learned something that went deep into your psyche and became a piece of what you’re doing now. But at least when it comes to the goal-oriented life, only about 1 percent of the efforts you made paid off.

Economists refer to this sensitivity to price as elasticity of demand. When you can delay the purchase of a good, if it has many close substitutes, or if it takes a large percentage of your income, demand is typically price sensitive or elastic. If, however, the purchase must be made immediately, no close substitutes exist, or the purchase does not take a significant percentage of income, demand is price insensitive or inelastic.

The key factor in supply elasticity is the amount of time it takes to produce the good or service. If producers can respond to price changes rapidly, supply is relatively elastic. However, if producers need considerable time to respond to changes in the market price of their product, supply is relatively inelastic.

prices are a function of the supply and demand for the good or service. Instead of central planners, government officials, or oligarchs dictating artificial prices or rationing who gets what, the market relies on the impersonal forces of supply and demand to determine prices and to serve the rationing function.

Governance differs from government in that it focuses less on the state and its institutions and more on social practices and activities. To understand governance requires that we look at abstract theories of hierarchy, market, and network as types of organizations, and then at more concrete debates about the shift from hierarchy to markets and networks in corporations, the public sector, and global politics.

There is, in fact, a way in which governments can be both big and small, generous and frugal, deeply involved in the lives of their citizens while stopping short of meddlesome intrusion. This is true in times of stability when the economy and society are ticking along nicely. But it is even more true in times of crisis, during financial downturns or pandemics, when the state has a crucial role to play but must do so efficiently and effectively. During the financial crisis of 2007–08, for instance, some governments did better than others at responding to the problems at hand in how they introduced and managed rescue packages and bailouts.

Next is the financial audit, which certifies financial statements of various departments, corporations or autonomous bodies rendering ‘true and fair accounts’, viz. whether they are properly prepared and with adequate disclosures. The third is the performance audit, wherein an attempt is made to establish whether policies, programmes and projects of the government are working in a cost-effective and efficient manner.

First of all, it doesn’t work. Even though you spend a lot of time, you don’t end up actually learning the material well. Methodically trying to reread every source covered in class is an incredibly inefficient way to prepare. And because it’s boring, your mind quickly fatigues, and once your mind shuts down, you can forget about synthesizing complicated arguments. To successfully learn even a modest amount of information using this technique requires an absurd number of hours. The second problem with rote review is that it’s really painful. There is no way around it: Cramming is mind numbing, especially when you have a hopelessly large amount of material to review.

Make sure that you have your assigned reading material gathered and ready to go before class begins

First priority: Record the problem statement and answer.           Even in the fastest class, there should be time to jot down the questions and final solutions. If you’re in the middle of writing down steps when the professor gives the answer and moves on to the next problem, skip the rest of the steps, record the answer, and move on too. You can try to come back during a lull to fill in more of the steps (so leave space), but even if you don’t, having only the problem and answer will still be useful for review later.           Second priority: Question the confusing.           Students who do well in technical courses are those who closely follow the problems being presented and then insist on asking questions when they don’t understand a specific step. Is this annoying? A little bit. Does it really improve your understanding of the techniques being presented? Absolutely. If you can’t ask a question, then at least clearly mark where you got confused. Write a bunch of question marks or circle the line in your notes; this will help you later

At its fundamental level, insurance is all about “pooling” risk together so that each individual member of the pool pays a relatively small amount in premium to be eligible to receive a large amount if they suffer a loss that has an economic impact. By taking advantage of the law of large numbers, insurance carriers can collect premiums and pay losses while maintaining a “house edge” to make a reasonable profit while providing a societal benefit by reducing downside risk to individuals. This new era of technological change will create fundamental change to the current insurance ecosystem in ways that are not yet evident and cannot be fully anticipated today.  In fact, future risk transfer paradigms may not even be referred to as “insurance.”  Perhaps technological change will enable new business models such as “risk sharing” that will become the new dominant paradigm for risk transfer.     THE BOLD AND THE BRAVE   Many of the recent insurtech startups and similar ventures will fail.  In fact, it is highly likely that the vast majority of them will go bankrupt if history is any guide.  But it would be foolish to bet that all of them will fail, and there is a fair likelihood that one or more will succeed wildly in the way that Uber has in the ride-sharing industry and Airbnb has in the home-sharing space.  Those players - whether traditional incumbents,

most effective way to imprint a concept is to first review it and then try to explain it, unaided, in your own words. If you can close your eyes and articulate an argument from scratch, or stare at a blank sheet of paper and reproduce a solution without a mistake, then you have fully imprinted that concept. It’s not going anywhere.

These question marks are dangerous. As Christine from Harvard puts it, by skipping a point made in a lecture, “you’re gambling with the possibility of being truly in the dark on the exam.” The scenario is simple. During the semester a few topics slip past your attention in class, so you end up with a handful of question marks in your notes. When it comes time to study, you have more than enough big ideas that you do understand, and that you need to review, so the occasional question-marked topic gets ignored. You enter the exam feeling prepared, and then, as luck would have it, you find yourself face-to-face with a big essay question covering one of those bypassed concepts. Whoops. To prevent this from happening, you need to eliminate these question marks. The key is to start this process well before the exam. If you leave all of these question marks unanswered until you start studying, you will end up spending many extra hours looking up the required explanations. Learning a large quantity of material from scratch during the review process is a mistake made by average students—and you should avoid this. Instead, try to knock off question marks as soon as they arrive. By the time you begin studying you should, as Robert, a straight-A student from Brown, explains, “have at least a vague

We all want to be happy. But life is also about education, work, courage, honor, empathy, and resilience in the face of hardship. Real contentment comes from a feeling that your life is worthwhile, that it is dissolved into something meaningful and great. That leads to gratitude. And gratitude, it turns out, is an indispensable part of happiness.

Respect your elders. Two ears, one mouth: Listen twice as much as you talk. When you give your word, keep it. Always. Look people in the eye when you talk to them. Stand up for yourself. Smile—it doesn’t cost anything. If you don’t have the time to do it right, how will you find the time to do it over? Spend less than what you earn. Save and invest the difference. Always say “please” and “thank you,” “yes sir,” and “no ma’am.” Understand that the workplace is a hierarchy, not a democracy. If you borrow something, return it in better condition than you got it. Learn to think for yourself. If you don’t know something, look it up. Cigarettes don’t make you look cool. They make you look dumb. Drugs deliver short-term highs and lifelong lows. Sex is great, but unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases are not. When you need help, ask for it. When others need help, give it. Doing the right thing always has its reward. If you mess up, apologize. Anything worth having is worth working for. Do what you love and the money will follow. (Not enough to make you rich necessarily, but enough to live an authentic life.) You don’t need someone to complete you. Complete yourself. Successful people make a habit of doing the things unsuccessful people don’t want to do. Hold the door for people—men and women alike. Accept responsibility for yourself. If you face a difficult decision, ask, “How will this make me feel about myself?” And never forget: Illegitimi non carborundum. (That’s mock Latin for “Don’t let the bastards grind you down.”)

At FreedomFest in Las Vegas two years ago, psychologist Nathaniel Branden gave a talk on self-esteem. Self-esteem, he said, is not about looking in the mirror and saying, “I’m so special, aren’t I wonderful?” Nor, he argued, is self-esteem something that is a gift of nature. It has to be cultivated. It has to be earned.

On a trip to California to visit Branden, Murray—an avid wine collector—was shown a rare and exorbitantly priced Cabernet at a local wine shop. He looked at it admiringly but told the owner the cost was prohibitive. When he arrived back at Branden’s home, however, he discovered that the storeowner had mistakenly sold him the expensive wine at the price of the modest bottle he had selected. So he rode back to town to return it. The store owner was both relieved and astonished. He had quickly recognized his mistake, but since Murray was an out-of-towner and had paid in cash, he felt certain he would never see him again. Back at Branden’s home, Murray conveyed his own disbelief. “I don’t understand his surprise,” he said. “If I had kept that bottle of wine, I wouldn’t have liked the way that made me feel about myself.” Finishing the story, Branden paused and looked out at the audience. “That,” he said emphatically, “is self-esteem.” Perhaps. But I prefer to think of it as honor.

Ancient Japanese and Chinese philosophers meandered around lakes and mountains, preserving their thoughts in gemlike poetry. Jesus of Nazareth was an itinerant preacher who walked 40 days and nights through the wilderness of Judea. The lyrical ballads of the English romantic poets were composed on long strolls through the countryside. Thomas Jefferson wrote to his favorite nephew Peter Carr: “You must take at least two hours a day to exercise; for health must not be sacrificed to learning. . . . Walking is very important. Never think of taking a book with you. The object of walking is to relax the mind. You should therefore not permit yourself even to think while you walk, but divert yourself by the objects surrounding you.” William Wordsworth is estimated to have walked 170,000 miles in his life and sparked a cottage industry of walking tours in England and Europe. Leaders of the American Renaissance—Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson—recommended long daily tramps. Thoreau wrote that he had “a genius, so to speak, for sauntering.” In a letter to his niece Jette, existentialist Søren Kierkegaard wrote, “Do not lose your desire to walk; every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it.” Wallace Stevens composed his poetry on daily walks between his home and his office in downtown Hartford. In his poem “Of the Surface of Things,” he wrote, “In my room, the world is beyond my understanding. But when I walk, I see that it consists of three or four hills and a cloud.”

As an example of both the higher sentiments and greater literacy of an earlier age, here is a letter from Sullivan Ballou, a 32-year-old soldier in the Union Army, to his 24-year-old wife: July 14, 1861 Camp Clark, Washington My very dear Sarah: The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write again, I feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more. . . . Sarah my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battle field. The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them for so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved together, and seen our sons grown up to honorable manhood, around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar, that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battle field, it will whisper your name. Forgive my many faults and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often times been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness. . . . But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights . . . always, always, and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath, as the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. Sarah do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again . . . Ballou was killed a week later in the first battle of Bull Run.

But the spiritual meaning of sloth is not laziness. It’s apathy, hardness of heart, moral indifference, blindness, complacency, and “smallness of soul.” Poverty, injustice, and suffering exist, in part, because we don’t act. Sloth is the category that encompasses everything we should do but don’t.

George Washington was one of Virginia’s wealthiest men (and, like virtually all plantation owners of his day, a slaveholder). Yet few risked more in defying tyranny than he did. When the revolutionary leaders pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, these were more than just fine-sounding words. This was treason. The founders knew that if the king’s soldiers caught them, they would be hanged. Yet Washington left his comfortable, aristocratic life and led a ragtag band of ill-trained, poorly clothed, underfed soldiers against the armed forces of the king of England and won our independence

There are only two ways to live: either without thinking of death . . . or with the thought that you approach death with every hour of your life. The more upset you are with other people and circumstances, and the more satisfied you are with yourself, the further you are from wisdom. Don’t compare yourself with others. Compare yourself only with perfection. It is not the place we occupy that is important, but the direction in which we move. When you want to escape from rage, do not walk, do not move, do not speak. Your rage cannot be justified by anything. The reason for your rage is always inside you. Speak only when your words are better than silence. For every time you regret that you did not say something, you will regret a hundred times that you did not keep your silence. There are two ways not to suffer from poverty. The first is to acquire more wealth. The second is to limit your requirements. The first is not always in our power. The second is. You do not have the right to be unhappy with your life. If you are not satisfied, see this as a reason to be unsatisfied with yourself. The more strictly and mercilessly you judge yourself, the more just and kind you will be in the judgment of others. Strive for goodness without any expectations for rapid or noticeable success. For the further you progress, the higher your ideal of perfection will rise. Yet it is the process itself, this striving, that justifies our lives.

In the summer of 1941, for example, Sergeant James Allen Ward was awarded the Victoria Cross for climbing out onto the wing of his Wellington bomber in midflight to extinguish a fire in the starboard engine. Secured only by a rope around his waist, he smothered the fire and managed to crawl back into the cabin. Winston Churchill, a great admirer of swashbuckling exploits, summoned the soldier to 10 Downing Street. Struck dumb with awe in Churchill’s presence, however, Ward struggled to answer even the most basic questions. Surveying the unhappy hero, Churchill said, “You must feel very humble and awkward in my presence.” “Yes sir,” stammered Ward. “Then you can imagine how humble and awkward I feel in yours,” replied Churchill. The British prime minister got it exactly right.

This point was made 1,700 years ago in a well-known dialogue between Alexander the Great and the Greek philosopher Diogenes: Alexander: Diogenes, you are a man of great repute. Yet you spend your days untroubled, unperturbed, indulging in conversation and the pleasures of life. Diogenes: Tell me what is so much better about the life of Alexander the Great? Alexander: I am a conqueror of nations! Diogenes: So, conqueror of nations, what are you going to do next? Alexander: I will conquer Greece! Diogenes: Yes . . . then what? Alexander: I will conquer Asia Minor! Diogenes: Alright . . . then what? Alexander: I will conquer the rest of the world! Diogenes: And then? Alexander: Then . . . I plan to relax and enjoy life. Diogenes: So why not relax and enjoy it now? He must have made an impression. The great conqueror once observed, “Were I not Alexander, I would be Diogenes.”

The phrase Philosophia Perennis—the Perennial Philosophy—was coined by the German mathematician, philosopher, and polymath Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). In more recent years, Aldous Huxley, Mortimer Adler, and Huston Smith, among other writers, carried the perennialist torch, beckoning us to take part in what they call “The Great Conversation.”

Perennialists understand the connection between compassion and successful living. They offer, for example, that: Everything worthwhile in life is created as the result of love and concern for others. Humanity is one great family. Our similarities are deep, our differences superficial. The Golden Rule, expressed in some way in every society, is the cornerstone of human understanding. The giving of time, money, support, and encouragement can never be detrimental to the giver. Character development—the path from self-absorption to caring and consciousness—is paramount. Problems are life’s way of getting the best out of us. They are opportunities to grow. It is important to nourish your mind with the thoughts of history’s wisest thinkers. Courage and self-awareness are required to live fully and follow your heart. You should develop the ability to reason accurately and independently rather than accepting ideas based solely on authority or tradition. Our egos cause us to cherish opinions, judge others, and rationalize our beliefs. Perennialists ask “Would you rather be right or be happy?” We should exercise humility. Not because others find it attractive (although they do) but because, if we are honest with ourselves, we have much to be humble about. We should practice forgiveness. When we forgive others, we find that others forgive us—and that we forgive ourselves. Moral development comes from strengthening our impulse control, prioritizing personal relationships, and fostering social responsibility. Our lives are immeasurably improved by expressing gratitude and generosity. Development of the heart is essential. Our actions are the mirror of our inner selves. Whenever we act, we are never just doing. We are always becoming. If we aren’t growing, we are diminishing.

Verse 8 says: Fill your bowl to the brim and it will spill. Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt. Chase after money and security and your heart will never unclench. Care about people’s approval and you will be their prisoner. Do your work, then step back. The only path to serenity. Taoism offers an alternative view of abundance, one that values maintaining dignity over acquiring social position, and enjoying free time over acquiring possessions. Culture, society, and technology have changed a great deal over the past few thousand years. But the Taoist philosophy remains relevant. For example: Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. Or consider this timeless nugget: Wise men don’t need to prove their point; Men who need to prove their point aren’t wise. Lao Tzu said we should have a nature like water. Water can be forceful, yet it is always the first to yield, moving quickly around obstacles and relentlessly seeking the simplest path. With time and persistence, water will wear away the tallest mountains and transform the landscape. People who are confrontational—who remain dogmatic—never learn this lesson. They are more interested in being right than moving forward. The Tao Te Ching says: People are born gentle and weak; at their death they are hard

Taoism teaches that to be truly free we must be able to work with change rather than against it. We should be humble, flexible, and detached from most worldly concerns. The art of abundance is often a matter of recognizing, appreciating, and celebrating life as it is: If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never be truly fulfilled. If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself. Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.

What is the secret of eloquence, the standard of virtue, the basis of moral authority, the object of philosophy, the most formidable power on earth, the noblest expression of the human spirit, and beauty itself? Thoreau said it was better than money, love, or fame. The New Testament proclaims it is the basis of freedom (John 8:32). Schopenhauer observed that it is first ridiculed, then violently oppressed, then accepted as self-evident. The answer, of course, is truth. Yet you’ll notice that the supply often exceeds demand.

The first is tradition. These are beliefs that are handed down from grandparents to parents to children and so on. The problem here, of course, is that if a particular fact or story or folk remedy was in error to begin with, it’s as untrue today as it was originally, no matter how many generations have passed it along. The second source is authority. If a teacher, public official, or religious leader tells us something is true, we’re more inclined to accept it. This can be a valid shortcut. But, regardless of their credentials, experts are often mistaken. Just because information comes from someone important, it doesn’t guarantee its reliability. The third source of belief is reason and evidence. Here we are on firmer ground. Historians use documents, letters, and photographs to piece together the past. Judges base their opinions on physical and circumstantial evidence, eyewitness testimony, and confirmed facts. Scientists construct hypotheses, test them by observation and experiment, share their methods, and offer the results for acceptance or rejection.

During these periods, he took the time to write down his key principles. Here are just a few of his thoughts: In matters of conscience, the law of the majority has no place. All of your scholarship, all your study of Shakespeare and Wordsworth would be in vain if at the same time you did not build your character and attain mastery over your thoughts and your actions. A man is but the product of his thoughts. What he thinks, he becomes. The only tyrant I accept in this world is the “still small voice” within. Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will. I do not want to foresee the future. I am concerned with taking care of the present. What a great thing it would be if we, in our busy lives, could retire into ourselves each day, for at least a couple of hours, and prepare our minds to listen to the voice of the great silence. Experience has taught me that silence is a part of the spiritual discipline of a votary of truth. Proneness to exaggerate, to suppress or modify truth, wittingly or unwittingly, is a natural weakness of man, and silence is necessary to surmount it. A man of few words will rarely be thoughtless in his speech. He will measure every word. True happiness is impossible without true health, and true health is impossible without rigid control of the palate. All the other senses will automatically come under our control when the palate has been brought under control. And he who has conquered his senses has really conquered the whole world.

The habit of reading is one of the greatest resources of mankind; and we enjoy reading books that belong to us much more than if they are borrowed. A borrowed book is like a guest in the house; it must be treated with punctiliousness, with a certain considerate formality. You must see that it sustains no damage; it must not suffer while under your roof. You cannot leave it carelessly, you cannot mark it, you cannot turn down the pages, and you cannot use it familiarly. And then, someday, although this is seldom done, you really ought to return it.

Thales of Mileters strove to understand the natural forces that regulate the universe and gave birth to the scientific method. Pythagoras proved that the universe operates according to mathematical laws. Archimedes calculated the value of pi—the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter—and demonstrated the principle of leverage. (“Give me a place to stand,” he famously said, “and I will move the earth.”) Euclid wrote treatises on geometry, optics, and music theory. Ptolemy attempted to diagram the heavens, laying the foundation of modern astronomy. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle founded Western philosophy with their sophisticated inquiries into metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.

If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this that disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power to wipe out this judgment now. Be like the jutting rock against which waves are constantly crashing, and all around it the frothing foam then settles back down. Say not “Oh, I am so unfortunate that this has happened to me.” But rather “How fortunate I am that, even though this has happened to me, I continue uninjured, neither terrified by the present nor in fear of the future.” Never consider anything to be beneficial to you, which could ever compel you to violate your faith in yourself, to abandon your modesty, to hate anybody, to be overly suspicious, cursing, disingenuous, or to lust after anything which must be hidden behind walls or veils. Wisdom and right action are the same thing. Whenever you notice someone else going astray, immediately turn and examine how you yourself have gone astray, for example, esteeming money, pleasure, reputation, or something else, as if it were the highest good. Examine yourself in this way and you will quickly forget your anger. People seek retreats for themselves in the country, by the sea, and near the mountains, and you too are especially prone to desire such things. But this is a sign of ignorance, since you have the power to retire within yourself whenever you wish. For nowhere can a person retire more full of peace and free from care than into his own soul. Kindness is unconquerable, so long as it is without flattery or hypocrisy. For what can the most insolent man do to you if you continue to be kind to him? The noblest way of taking revenge on others is by refusing to become like them. If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is wrong, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one ever was truly harmed. Someone else may ask: “How may I possess that?” But you should ask: “How may I not covet that?” Someone else asks: “How can I be rid of him?” But you: “How can I not wish to be rid of him?” Another: “How may I not lose my little child?” But you: “How may I not dread the loss of my child?” Turn your prayers around entirely, and see what happens

More than 150 years ago, Thoreau blamed this on the rat race and materialism: Most men would feel insulted if it were proposed to employ them in throwing stones over a wall, and then in throwing them back, merely that they might earn their wages. But many are no more worthily employed now. Men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon ploughed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasure, which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool’s life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before

The World Bank reports that 1.4 billion men and women around the world currently live on less than $1.25 a day. A survey of over 60,000 of them in 73 countries found that extreme poverty like this means: You probably live in an unstable house, made of mud or thatch, that is liable to collapse in severe weather. You lack adequate food, education, clothing, sanitation, and health care. You often eat one meal a day, sometimes having to choose between stilling your child’s hunger or your own. You have no safe drinking water. (Or you may need to carry it a long way and, even then, it may not be safe until you boil it.) If a family member becomes ill and you need money to see a doctor, you may have to borrow from a moneylender who charges usurious rates—and you may never be free of the debt. You have a pervading sense of powerlessness, misery, and shame because you cannot provide adequately for your family.

Waiting for you on the other side of fear is freedom: Freedom from anxiety. Freedom from regret. Freedom from a life unlived. Fortune really does favor the brave. Marianne Williamson writes: Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? . . . We are all meant to shine, as children do. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. Does this mean—like Hannah—that I’m willing to embrace “Whistler’s Ultimate Adrenaline Rush” and plummet toward the Cheakamus River? That depends. How many burly guys have you got?

The most enduring traditions emerged between 800 and 200 bc, a period German philosopher Karl Jaspers called the “Axial Age.” During this time, humanity experienced a flowering of spiritual development with Confucianism and Taoism is China, Buddhism and Hinduism in India, monotheism in the Middle East and Greek rationalism in Europe. It was then that people began to see both their limitations and their possibilities with unprecedented clarity. Axial sages taught that justice, integrity, and compassion benefit both the individual and society. More than two millennia later, these traditions still endure.

It’s important to live life with the experience, and therefore the knowledge, of its mystery and of your own mystery. This gives life a new radiance, a new harmony, a new splendor. Thinking in mythological terms helps to put you in accord with the inevitables of this vale of tears. You learn to recognize the positive values in what appear to be the negative moments and aspects of your life. The big question is whether you are going to be able to say a hearty yes to your adventure. The adventure of a hero.

Karen Armstrong described an excellent approach in a recent interview: A Socratic dialogue never ends with somebody defeating somebody else and forcing them into another frame of mind. A Socratic dialogue is actually a spiritual exercise, and Socrates said it would not work unless it was conducted at every single point with gentleness. You offer your opinion to your conversation partner as a gift, expressing it beautifully. And he would listen and allow it into his heart and would give you something back, too. And you would not enter into one of these conversations unless you expected to be changed by the encounter. Otherwise, you end up with a diatribe, not a dialogue.

In A Short History of Nearly Everything (Broadway, 2003), Bill Bryson writes: You have been extremely—make that miraculously—fortunate in your personal ancestry. Consider the fact that for 3.8 billion years, a period of time older than the Earth’s mountains and rivers and oceans, every one of your forebears on both sides has been attractive enough to find a mate, healthy enough to reproduce, and sufficiently blessed by fate and circumstances to live long enough to do so. Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed, devoured, drowned, starved, stranded, stuck fast, untimely wounded, or otherwise deflected from its life’s quest of delivering a tiny charge of genetic material to the right partner at the right moment in order to perpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary combinations that could result—eventually, astoundingly, and all too briefly—in you.

I wish I had a big staff—or even a single editor—to thank for helping me research and write these essays. But this was almost entirely a solo project. Not that I’m complaining. I would rather spend an afternoon writing an essay than going to the beach or playing a round of golf. (If you saw my backswing, you’d understand why.) I learned a lot researching and writing this book and am always grateful for an opportunity to remedy my ignorance.

I do want to clear up a misunderstanding about the acknowledgments in my most recent book, The Secret of Shelter Island. I’m referring specifically to the part where I said, “I hate Bill Bryson. All writers should. If you don’t know why, read everything he’s written.” This was intended—I thought it was obvious—as a compliment. Bryson is not just my favorite contemporary author. He is the kind of writer who makes the rest of us feel like amateurs, frauds, and poseurs, that our true calling is not writing, but perhaps driving nails, running a day care center, or working at the local Waffle House. I have never met Bill Bryson. But I have read him—and I sit at his feet.

The writer must be “superior” to the reader in understanding, and his book must convey in readable form the insights he possesses and his potential readers lack. Second, the reader must be able to overcome this inequality in some degree, seldom perhaps fully, but always approaching equality with the writer. To the extent that equality is approached, clarity of communication is achieved.

The art of reading, in short, includes all of the same skills that are involved in the art of unaided discovery: keenness of observation, readily available memory, range of imagination, and, of course, an intellect trained in analysis and reflection. The reason for this is that reading in this sense is discovery, too—although with help instead of without it.

Students in school often read difficult books with the help and guidance of teachers. But for those of us who are not in school, and indeed also for those of us who are when we try to read books that are not required or assigned, our continuing education depends mainly on books alone, read without a teacher’s help. Therefore if we are disposed to go on learning and discovering, we must know how to make books teach us well. That, indeed, is the primary goal of this book.

The goal a reader seeks—be it entertainment, information or understanding—determines the way he reads. The effectiveness with which he reads is determined by the amount of effort and skill he puts into his reading. In general, the rule is: the more effort the better, at least in the case of books that are initially beyond our powers as readers and are therefore capable of raising us from a condition of understanding less to one of understanding more. Finally, the distinction between instruction and discovery (or between aided and unaided discovery) is important because most of us, most of the time, have to read without anyone to help us. Reading, like unaided discovery, is learning from an absent teacher.

Another name for this level might be comparative reading. When reading syntopically, the reader reads many books, not just one, and places them in relation to one another and to a subject about which they all revolve. But mere comparison of texts is not enough. Syntopical reading involves more. With the help of the books read, the syntopical reader is able to construct an analysis of the subject that may not be in any of the books. It is obvious, therefore, that syntopical reading is the most active and effortful kind of reading.

The first question in the field of public policy is: What should the state do? A great deal of good policy reform can be obtained by putting an end to certain government activities, and by initiating new areas of work that better fit into the tasks of government. The state has a monopoly of violence. All activities of the state are grounded in coercion: either directly (when the state demands that private persons behave in certain ways) or indirectly (when the state uses threats of violence to collect tax revenues, and then spends them in certain ways).

A great deal of good policy reform can be obtained by putting an end to certain government activities, and by initiating new areas of work that better fit into the tasks of government. The state has a monopoly of violence. All activities of the state are grounded in coercion: either directly (when the state demands that private persons behave in certain ways) or indirectly (when the state uses threats of violence to collect tax revenues, and then spends them in certain ways). Coercion of private persons is the unique thing that only the state can do. Coercion is an unpleasant thing and can easily go wrong. Building the republic is about creating ethical control systems that contain and channel state violence for the common good. The founding intuition of the field of public policy is the notion that freedom works pretty well. Left to themselves, free men and women achieve reasonably good outcomes in most situations. Freedom works well most of the time, but there are exceptions: the four kinds of ‘market failure’. These are: Externalities, public goods, market power and asymmetric information. On its own, the free market often fares poorly at dealing with these situations. This is where the state can add value in society, by addressing market failure. All states do some amount of redistribution. For example, relief work done by the government after a natural disaster is a case of transferring the money obtained in coercive ways (through taxation) from the populace to the affected people

Paper writing is hard, but the good news is that it doesn’t have to be as hard as most students make it. Let’s begin by taking a closer look at the paper-writing process itself, which can be broken down into three separate components: 1. Sifting through existing arguments. 2. Forming your own argument. 3. Communicating your argument clearly.

The straight-A strategy is made up of eight steps. We start by discussing how to find a topic that will hold your interest and how to locate a thesis within the topic that is both interesting and supportable. From there, we move on to the research effort. This step is crucial, as research, perhaps more than any other part of the paper-writing process, is where the most time can be wasted. We present a streamlined system for gathering and annotating the right material as quickly as possible. After research comes argument construction. There is, unfortunately, no simple system that guarantees a smart argument. But we do describe helpful strategies for gathering feedback on your argument and recording it in an outline format that best facilitates the steps that follow.

Your first pass through your work should be conducted on your computer. Read carefully, and focus on the presentation of your arguments—don’t worry about small grammatical mistakes for the moment. Take in the paper one paragraph at a time. If a section is awkwardly stated, clarify the sentences. If it makes a point you already explained earlier, ruthlessly cut it out. If the argument is lacking detail, add in more sentences as necessary to fully explain your point. If a transition is lacking between topics or paragraphs, add one.

Part Three Cheat Sheet Step #1. Target a Titillating Topic • Start looking for an interesting topic early. Step #2. Conduct a Thesis-Hunting Expedition • Start with general sources and then follow references to find the more targeted sources where good thesis ideas often hide. Step #3. Seek a Second Opinion • A thesis is not a thesis until a professor has approved it. Step #4. Research like a Machine • Find sources. • Make personal copies of all sources. • Annotate the material. • Decide if you’re done. (If the answer is “no,” loop back to #1.) Step #5. Craft a Powerful Story • There is no shortcut to developing a well-balanced and easy-to-follow argument. • Dedicate a good deal of thought over time to getting it right. • Describe your argument in a topic-level outline. • Type supporting quotes from sources directly into your outline. Step #6. Consult Your Expert Panel • Before starting to write, get some opinions on the organization of your argument and your support from classmates and friends who are familiar with the general area of study. • The more important the paper, the more people who should review it. Step #7. Write Without the Agony • Follow your outline and articulate your points clearly. • Write no more than three to five pages per weekday and five to eight pages per weekend day. Step #8. Fix, Don’t Fixate • Solid editing requires only three careful passes: – The Argument Adjustment Pass: Read the paper carefully on your computer to make sure your argument is clear, fix obvious errors, and rewrite where the flow needs improvement. – The Out Loud Pass: Carefully read out loud a printed copy of your paper, marking any awkward passages or unclear explanations. – The Sanity Pass: A final pass over a printed version of the paper to check the overall flow and to root out any remaining errors.

Compared to for-profit firms, non-profit and governmental organizations often function as a monopoly, produce a product or service that offers little or no measurability of performance, and are totally dependent on outside financing. They thus face a challenge in getting the right amount of funds to keep functioning because the profits are not the motive. Especially for these organizations, strategic management provides an excellent vehicle for developing and justifying requests for financial support.

The turtle was standing outside his gate with a basket full of a wide assortment of flowers. The rabbit looked at the basket and the bouquet of roses he’d bought for his mom (his mom loves roses so that’s what he got her). ‘How?’ the astonished rabbit asked the turtle. ‘While you went straight to the florist, I just hopped around to all the places I’ve seen flowers grow over the years. Places just around the corner from home but off the beaten track. It’s not the most standard or straightforward way to do it, but it got the job done in its own unique way. Nice roses, by the way.’

If you do want to go deeper into this concept, the ‘Three Whys’ method is a good place to start. This was something I came across in Chip Heath and Dan Heath’s book Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die. The method is simple. When you’re trying to understand the emotional core of a particular thing or idea, write down why you think people are doing it, and then write down why it is important three times. You’ll notice that each successive answer takes you deeper into understanding the true nature and core of the idea as well as the emotion behind it.

If you take note of who they reference, what they read, watch, listen to or just connect with in a systematic way, then you have more knowledge to consume on what you already relate to. This often helps you dig deeper and gives you a more diverse perspective, especially when you check out people the individual doesn’t agree with as much but references often.

In Russian folklore there is an archetype called yurodivy, or the ‘Holy Fool’. The Holy Fool is a social misfit—eccentric, off-putting, sometimes even crazy—who nonetheless has access to the truth. Nonetheless is actually the wrong word. The Holy Fool is a truth-teller because he is an outcast. Those who are not part of existing social hierarchies are free to blurt out inconvenient truths or question things the rest of us take for granted. Malcolm Gladwell, Talking to Strangers

To discover the new we need the old, because everything that is new has been built on the foundation of something that has come before. All the knowledge of the past and all the information from the present can help us visualize and create the future. So never scoff at tradition—learn from it, absorb as much as you can about it. But, and this is the most important condition, don’t think twice before questioning it and reshaping it as you see fit.

Try to absorb as much knowledge as you can about the problem at hand. Learn, ask, search for any and all information around it. The more we learn, the less of a niggle it will be; it will transform from a problem to a gateway of learning. This also helps fight the biggest impediment to knowledge and learning—ignorance! Or rather, our tendency to be satisfied with our own ignorance. All the months I spent saying, ‘I guess it’s because I worked out wrongly,’ or ‘Maybe it’s the way I sleep,’ or ‘It’s just something people with a long neck have to live with,’ were months I spent ignoring the fact that I didn’t know enough to come to a conclusion and lacked the mental drive to fight that ignorance.

This realization has fundamentally changed how I operate in life.

The principles—reciprocation, liking, social proof, authority, scarcity, commitment and consistency, and unity—are discussed both in terms of their function in society and in terms of how their enormous force can be commissioned by a compliance professional who deftly incorporates them into requests for purchases, donations, concessions, votes, or assent.1

Enron recruited big talent, mostly people with fancy degrees, which is not in itself so bad. It paid them big money, which is not that terrible. But by putting complete faith in talent, Enron did a fatal thing: It created a culture that worshiped talent, thereby forcing its employees to look and act extraordinarily talented. Basically, it forced them into the fixed mindset. And we know a lot about that. We know from our studies that people with the fixed mindset do not admit and correct their deficiencies.

As at Enron, those with the fixed mindset did not profit from their mistakes. But those with the growth mindset kept on learning. Not worried about measuring—or protecting—their fixed abilities, they looked directly at their mistakes, used the feedback, and altered their strategies accordingly. They became better and better at understanding how to deploy and motivate their workers, and their productivity kept pace. In fact, they ended up way more productive than those with the fixed mindset. What’s more, throughout this rather grueling task, they maintained a healthy sense of confidence. They operated like Alan Wurtzel.

The unions were dead against the restructuring idea and, despite the hundreds of hours of negotiations, we failed to get them on board. The restructuring plan was finally shelved, and I later realized I had forgotten the lesson from my Mussoorie trek about having a core team that could open back channels of communication with the ‘opposers’. In this situation, having a small UPSRTC team of experienced and credible officers open informal, behind-the-scenes parleys with targeted trade union leaders may have helped in breaking the deadlock.

It turned out that some of the ‘export certificates’ (allotted to the garment exporters’ part of the quota) had been forged, and a large quantity of tailored collar shirts had already been illegally exported from India to Canada by unscrupulous exporters. This was what had caused the breaching of the overall ‘national quota’ ceiling for this product, leaving the genuine holders of the tailored collar shirt ‘quota’ stranded. Mr St Jacques refused to consider allowing the imports from genuine quota holders because, technically, India’s total export ‘quota’ in this category had already been exceeded.

While the TLC was slowly gathering steam, we were still struggling to get both trainees and teachers out in big numbers. Bijnor had a large Muslim population and a majority of both the trainees and teachers were Muslim. Then, a brilliant idea by Kamran Rizvi helped accelerate progress exponentially. He suggested I call a meeting of all the imams (Muslim priests) in Bijnor district and request them to use their authority to appeal to all the Muslim women and girls in their mosque’s jurisdiction to come out and participate in the campaign.

A good example of this was the reduction of the project scheme cycle of 27 months. We had initially thought that 12 months would be required for the village community to complete the planning phase. Instead, we soon found that the communities in the early phase of the Swajal project became impatient with what they saw as excessive planning and wanted the implementation phase to start earlier. Based on this feedback, we shortened the 12-month planning phase to three months and the overall scheme cycle from 27 months to 18 months. One of the early lessons I learned, therefore, was that a project design only holds good until the implementation commences, and that fancy ‘five-star’ models may look good on paper but do not always correspond to ground reality

While most young professionals in the private sector are, or become, specialists in a particular field (even if they tend to move from one organization to another), I am convinced that young IAS officers need to develop a specialization of their choice after they finish their field stint as DM.

As a result, the officer tends to become a ‘generalist’ of sorts after the DM tenure, and could very well end up with postings in varied departments such as Finance, Home or Urban Development, without ever actually knowing much about these sectors. Given that most IAS officers are involved with policy-making at a senior level, it is important to develop some level of expertise and experience of the sector to be truly effective. For this, a deeper dive into a particular sector at a relatively early stage of an IAS officer’s career is critical. While I fortuitously became a ‘water-and-sanitation-wala’ through my Swajal experience, I think it is time that the system actively promotes specialization for young IAS officers and then posts them to the related sector.

The PforR lending instrument introduced a radically new approach to the World Bank’s lending, directly linking disbursement of the loan to the delivery of verifiable results. Previous loans had focused more on loan disbursement than actual achievement of the planned outcomes of the project. This results-based approach to financing development programmes has proved to be very useful in terms of incentivizing and optimizing outcomes, and is increasingly being adopted by government-funded programmes across the world. In India, too, results-based financing is becoming the norm, especially for infrastructure projects.

LEADERS OFTEN ARTICULATE lofty goals. Whether they lead countries, companies or other organizations, they usually declare their vision and expect their teams to translate them into reality. One of the most common pitfalls in such a situation, however, is the lack of congruence between the articulated vision of the leader and the level of belief, enthusiasm and understanding of the teams tasked with implementing the vision. The lack of belief in achieving the goal can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. As they say, if you think you can, you will; if you think you can’t, you won’t!

‘Me too.’ I could see there were already some local ‘champions’ in the community committed to playing their part in ending the age-old habit of defecating in the open.

The first was the sheer scale of the problem: changing the behaviour of 550 million rural Indians used to defecating in the open, coupled with making available over 100 million toilets for them to use.

He felt we should focus from a distance – read Delhi – on the overall monitoring of the programme and let the states get on with the job. I was also reminded that at the time of the start of the SBM, in October 2014, the country had a rural sanitation coverage of less than 40 per cent, and that there was no way we could go from 39 per cent to 100 per cent in just five years. He added, for good measure, that such a wildly ambitious programme had never even been attempted in such a short time anywhere in the world

Finding a team of believers Fortunately, like in the Swajal project, I was once again given carte blanche to get a new set of officers and, after casting the recruitment net far and wide, I handpicked the following crew of ‘believers’ to join the ‘new normal’ in the Ministry: (i) Arun Baroka, a knowledgeable and experienced IAS officer from the AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh–Goa–Mizoram–Union Territory) cadre, (ii) Akshay Rout, a dynamic officer from the Indian Information Service, (iii) V.

We already had Nipun Vinayak, a young and energetic IAS officer who was passionate about sanitation, and were also fortunate to inherit Seemantinee Sengupta, our calm management information system (MIS) head; O.P. Agarwal, who provided the MIS technology backbone for the SBM operation; and Junaid, a long-standing consultant who was the institutional memory for the pre-SBM sanitation programmes.

This can-do attitude of our team was one of the reasons for the rapid progress towards the SBM goal.

Starting with daily meetings with the entire team for Mission 100 (making 100 districts ODF in my first year), we moved onto Mission 300 meetings in Year 2 and then Mission Quality and Sustainability meetings from Year 3 onwards. These meetings were attended by all team members. In the large conference room adjacent to my office, 30 to 40 people would come together for a free exchange of information and ideas as well as daily progress monitoring. A war room was also set up to track the advancement towards the ODF goal, with each team member given a set of districts and states to monitor. A new sense of energy and belief became palpable within a few months of my joining and, as results started coming in, the belief in the goal was reinforced and grew stronger.

I also adopted a fairly democratic way of conducting meetings. While the senior officers in the Ministry would sit with me at the head of the table, the discussions were open to all team members, including consultants. Everyone was expected to focus on the discussion at hand, not conduct side conversations and, most importantly, not be glued to their mobile phone or be scouring the internet on their laptops.

It was fascinating how the wheel had turned full circle: from being a DM myself many years ago, I had now returned, grey-haired, to market the SBM to a new lot of young, dynamic officers, many of whom were sceptical about my ‘new and exciting’ product: a toilet! And, while I had had only one or two development programmes to focus on in Bijnor, these modern-day DMs had too many programmes on their plates to implement and found it difficult to focus on any one, even if it was the CM’s top priority. We had to get the DMs enthused about our programme. There were ‘easy’ districts and there were ‘difficult’ districts, and we had to motivate the DMs of both

I saw that the young officer was a little perturbed. When I asked him what the problem was, he replied that much as he was excited about the SBM, he was being pulled in so many directions that he could not focus enough on our programme. It struck me then that we needed to provide some local support to the DMs to enable them to better implement the SBM. This led to the idea of creating a fellowship for young and talented professionals who would work in districts and be the eyes, ears and arms of the DM in implementing the SBM. We also believed that they would bring energy and a fresh perspective to the execution of the programme.

We discussed various possibilities of implementing this idea. One option was to hire the young professionals ourselves but we didn’t have the capacity in government to do it fast enough. Another option was to try and create a consortium of private sector partners to loan some of their entry-level employees to be positioned in the field. I personally began reaching out to private foundations and trusts but they could not meet the demands in terms of the scale we were aiming for: one young professional per district. And so, this remained just a ‘good idea’, until the end of 2016, when senior members of the Tata Trusts came to my office to discuss how they could further support the SBM. It turned out to be a very fruitful meeting, where I asked them to consider taking up the entire fellowship themselves: recruit and sponsor one young professional per district in India. They had a quick consultation with their Chairman, Ratan Tata, and got back to me the next day to confirm they were on board.

In some cases, what worked was the health angle, that is, making parents, especially mothers, realize that defecating in the open meant flies would carry the excreta back to the food at home and consequently spread disease.

Over the programme period, depending on the context, triggering took on many shapes and hues. One of the most powerful triggering methods that I witnessed first-hand in a village in UP involved a swachhagrahi bringing with her a bottle of water to share with others during a ratri chaupal. It was hot and dry and it had been a long day for most of the assembled people. The villagers watched intently as the swachhagrahi passed the water bottle around. Some took a sip and passed it to others, and it eventually came back to the swachhagrahi. As she continued to talk, she plucked a strand of hair off her head, bent to dip the strand into a nearby pile of cow dung, and inserted it into the water bottle. She then offered the bottle of water to the people around her. This time around, she found no takers. When she asked the villagers why they didn’t want to have the water this time, they immediately responded that there was excreta in it. She then asked them if they had noticed flies sitting on their pile of excreta when they defecated in the open and then seen the same flies sit on their roti when they were eating a meal. They nodded in hushed silence. She then connected their disgust at being asked to drink from the contaminated water bottle with the image of a fly sitting on human excreta and then on their food. Surely, she stated theatrically, eating food on which the fly’s six legs had deposited somebody’s excreta was a definite no-no

The Twin-Pit Toilet Technology The substructure of the toilet (the part below the ground) consists broadly of two leach pits that are 1 m wide and just as deep. Above the ground is the superstructure (the toilet room) which contains a steeply sloping toilet bowl (which requires less water for flushing due to the gravity effect). Through a ‘Y’ junction box, the excreta is diverted into only one pit of the system, with the liquid leaching out into the earth and the solid settling down at the bottom of the pit. For a family of five, the pit usually fills up in a period of six or seven years. Once the first pit fills up, through the turn of a lever, the flow to it is stopped, and the junction box redirects the flow of excreta to the second pit. Meanwhile, in about a year, the excreta in the first pit decomposes into a greyish, odourless, powdery substance – ideal organic compost that is high in nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus content. We colloquially refer to it as sona khaad (golden fertilizer), and it can fetch a high price as a superb organic fertilizer for farming purposes.

After a few scoops, I was lifted out of the pit and my team entered one by one and repeated my act. Within an hour, most of the pit had been emptied and the contents placed on a blue sheet. We all scooped up some of the compost and held it out in our hands to demonstrate that it was absolutely safe to empty a pit and handle its decomposed contents, looking exactly like coffee powder, with our hands.

It has been a fascinating experience to have had the opportunity for several one-on-ones with PM Modi. I never left a meeting with him without having a novel idea to pursue or some new food for thought. He is always patient in listening, regardless of whether he is about to agree or disagree with somebody. He thinks big and outside the box. But what resonates the most with me is that he keeps a relentless focus on the last-mile delivery of development programmes, which, I think, is one of the most critical factors required for India to move ahead on its development path.

Indira suggested that I reach out to him: ‘You can at least tell him about your programme’s efforts at behaviour change and seek his advice.’ So, I contacted Mr Ninan and we met for coffee at a ‘neutral’ venue. While he started out being quite critical about the programme, I was at least partially successful in impressing upon him that we were trying hard to change behaviour but the scale of the problem was obviously a challenge. His blunt, very Ninan-like advice was for us to reach out more proactively to people outside the government and clearly communicate the SBM’s behaviour change strategy.

It was a very useful meeting and served two purposes. First, Mr Ninan understood – and hopefully appreciated – what we were trying to achieve. And, second, we began ramping up our communication strategy to the outside world.

An integral part of the job of Secretary to the Government of India is to represent one’s Ministry as a ‘witness’ at a Parliamentary Committee hearing a few times a year. This can be a harrowing experience, as the Hon’ble MPs are usually blunt and critical about the working of Ministries and do not hold back on asking tough questions of the ‘witness’: the Secretary.

After making a detailed presentation on the SBM and our rural drinking water programme and the broad implementation strategy going forward, I was bombarded with critical questions and comments by the MPs. Most of them pertained to implementation gaps on the ground in their respective constituencies. I attempted to respond to each of their questions and, despite my relative inexperience, it seemed that my belief in the SBM and willingness to take advice from the MPs had come through. Even Mr Azad seemed relatively non-combative in his questioning. Maybe the college connection had worked after all.

Direct outreach to our harshest critics, however, was important and we ourselves reached out to an assorted group of foes of the SBM, organizing the Swachh Bharat Dialogues with hard-boiled journalists and critical researchers from leading institutions across the country. I would like to be able to report to you that the Dialogues went off very well and that we ‘converted’ our critics into ‘true believers’, but the truth is that we were only partially successful. The Dialogues did result in us getting plenty of suggestions, some of which we accepted, but a large part of the advice was academic and came from people who did not understand the challenges of implementing programmes on the ground. The ‘glass-half-empty walas’ seemed to be an apt descriptor for them.

But the Dialogues did introduce us to some people who gave us great constructive advice, such as Dr N.C. Saxena, the highly regarded former civil servant and development expert. Not a person to mince words, he pointed out the problem of the pre-SBM single-pit toilets but also proposed the solution: retrofitting them by adding a second pit to ensure that the toilet need not be shut down after the single pit filled up. This was sound advice, which we duly followed.

As far as the ‘permanent’ insiders are concerned, as I have mentioned earlier, I believe that in this day and age of specialized skills and domain knowledge, it is important for the IAS to re-engineer itself and encourage officers, after about 15 years of field experience, to ‘specialize’ in certain broad areas such as the social sector, infrastructure, environment and energy, finance and economics, and so on.

It became apparent to me that this was spreading misinformation and giving the public a factually incorrect representation of the SBM.

And so, I decided to take the attack to the so-called critics by challenging their conjecture with facts, research and analytical rigour. I developed a rapid response theory: any news item that was based on conjecture rather than fact, or that made sweeping generalizations on the basis of inadequate research, would not be ignored by us at MDWS. Instead, we would respond to the publication house that carried the story with a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal on the same day, request the media house to carry our version of the story immediately, and thereby give the reader both perspectives and enable them to make an informed decision on what was true and what wasn’t.

but then made a major faux pas by saying, ‘Now is a critical time to replace the lens of those glasses [Gandhi’s glasses] with the human rights lens.’ This obviously did not go down well with us. The Mahatma was the foremost proponent of human rights, and sanitation had been his unique and special focus. His glasses, the logo of the SBM, epitomize core human rights principles.

We were shocked to learn that Mr Heller did not realize how the SBM had enhanced the quality of life and dignity of the people of rural India. In fact, this was the single biggest initiative in the world towards ensuring basic human rights. We put out our rapid response, strongly objecting to Mr Heller’s observations with a point-by-point rebuttal. It was probably tough on Mr Heller, but it had to be done.

Two more rounds of NARSS followed in 2018–19 and 2019–20. All three found that the sanitation coverage reported by the government was more or less accurate. They also confirmed that the usage of toilets across the country was high: above 90 per cent in all three surveys. These were strong validations of the results of the SBM, and my team left no stone unturned to make these findings known to one and all through press conferences, newspaper opinion pieces and social media.

In 2017, UNICEF carried out a study and estimated that in an ODF village, each family saved up to Rs 50,000 (about $700) per year in just medical costs they had avoided, not to mention the time savings which could be used more productively, and lives saved. Later that year, the BMGF conducted a study that found significantly lower instances of children with diarrhoea and malnourishment in ODF villages. In mid-2018, the WHO estimated that the SBM-G had saved more than 3,00,000 lives, mainly of children below the age of five, between 2014 and October 2019. In 2019, UNICEF found that ODF villages were 11.7 times less likely to have their groundwater sources contaminated. Later in the year, it estimated that the SBM had generated full-time employment for over 7.5 million people over the five-year programme period.

On that cold November day in Normandy, while listening to our tour guide describe the beach landing of the Allied forces on D-Day – 6 June 1944 – I had a sudden insight. I realized that even after India became ODF, there would still be unfinished business to address before venturing into something new. In any endeavour, including war, an experienced leader makes a special effort to consolidate and secure the gains made by his or her team before venturing into new territory. This is what the platoon commanders of the US Army did after finally gaining the upper hand during a fierce gun battle with the German defence forces on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. It was critical to consolidate their hard-fought gains by securing the beachhead before venturing into German-occupied France.

Similarly, I too would need to spend time and energy consolidating the gains of our ODF campaign, and institutionalizing ODF sustainability such that, with or without me, the SBM-G would ensure that people continued to use their toilets and no one defecated in the open in rural India.

The process followed was this: villages would declare themselves ODF, but would then be verified by a third party within three months of the declaration, and then re-verified six months from the first verification. The hypothesis was that a village that stayed ODF for about nine months would likely remain ODF for a lasting period.

We found out, however, through feedback from the field, that in some isolated cases, there were ‘slip backs’ in the form of a few people who still defecated in the open despite having been provided with toilets. Discussions with some global behaviour change experts like Val Curtis and Cass Sunstein also made us realize that a longer engagement – of two to three years – with ODF villages was required to consolidate the ODF outcomes, sustain them and make the changed behaviour the norm.

The case for a national drinking water programme In discussions with the PMO about a new national rural drinking water programme, I proposed that in areas where sufficient and clean groundwater was available, each village should implement their own small groundwater-based piped water supply scheme. Larger water supply schemes transporting water from rivers or reservoirs to many villages should only be implemented in groundwater-stressed areas or areas affected by water quality issues. Additionally, interventions to sustain the source of water, such as groundwater recharge, rainwater harvesting, and reuse of treated household wastewater, would be mandatory for all schemes, big or small. States would be financially incentivized based on a combination of performance and requirement, with a higher weightage to states with meagre water resources. The funds would be pooled in from different central and state schemes through convergence. And of course, as our experience from the SBM taught us, when the PM prioritized a programme and a dedicated team got to work to realize his vision, results followed.

The third, and probably the most unexpected, hat I donned was that of an auctioneer in a vegetable mandi. Well, not literally. A few weeks into the lockdown we had developed a sophisticated data management system and dashboard. And then we decided to go one step further. We knew there were many places with surplus supplies of fruits and vegetables, and many others which had a shortage. But this demand and supply were not able to speak to each other at the marketplace because most of them were shut down. And so, my team and I organized a videoconference connecting the sellers – state governments representing their farmers with surplus produce – directly with the buyers – the biggest wholesalers and e-commerce traders in the country. I played the role of the facilitator, middleman and even the ‘auctioneer’.

We formed self-help groups and provided them with new technology: Fibreglass crafts, outboard motors and fishing nets to enhance their productivity. We also introduced beach-level auctions so that earnings from their daily catch could be deposited in their bank accounts. The biggest challenge was to get bank accounts opened for the fishermen. It took us 10 months of chasing physical banks and bank managers to get this done. The process of ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) was a nightmare. Contrast this with my experience last month. I walked into a bank branch and opened my account using my biometric on a hand-held device in one minute flat. From 10 months to one minute has been the paradigm shift.

Since the notion of systems thinking first originated in Physics, continuing with the use of language from that field, these forces may be characterized as:       • Atomic forces (high power required, potential for high impact in near term) are very powerful and focused, and provide the system with its core strength. Breaking these atomic and subatomic bonds is possible and sometimes essential, but requires an equally powerful force to do so. Example: Increasing government spending on health from 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent of GDP.       • Gravitational forces (sustained effort resulting in gradual change over time) are also strong but diffused and draw strength from the shared knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of participants in the system. These forces may sometimes become essential to alter, but require a great deal of patience and perseverance to succeed. Example: Improving performance of human resources in health through mentoring and training.       • Magnetic forces (feasible, short-term

They soon concluded that their initial diagnosis had been wrong: Many of their employees already knew how to innovate, but they didn’t feel very engaged in the company, so they were unlikely to take initiative beyond what their job descriptions mandated. What the managers had first framed as a skill-set problem was better approached as a motivation problem. They abandoned all talk of innovation workshops and instead focused on improving employee engagement by (among other things) giving people more autonomy, introducing flexible working hours, and switching to a more participatory decision-making style.

We all appreciate in theory that others may experience a problem differently (or not see it at all). But as demonstrated in a study by Johannes Hattula, of Imperial College London, if managers try to imagine a customer’s perspective themselves, they typically get it wrong. To understand what other stakeholders think, you need to hear it from them.

A manager I know named Jeremiah Zinn did this when he led the product development team of the popular children’s entertainment channel Nickelodeon. The team was launching a promising new app, and lots of kids downloaded it. But actually activating the app was somewhat complicated, because it required logging in to the household’s cable TV service. At that point in the sign-up process, almost every kid dropped out. Seeing the problem as one of usability, the team put its expertise to work and ran hundreds of A/B tests on various sign-up flows, seeking to make the process less complex. Nothing helped. The shift came when Zinn realized that the team members had been thinking of the problem too narrowly. They had focused on the kids’ actions, carefully tracking every click and swipe—but they had not explored how the kids felt during the sign-up process. That turned out to be critical. As the team started looking for emotional reactions, it discovered that the request for the cable password made the kids fear getting in trouble: To a 10-year-old kid, a password request signals forbidden territory. Equipped with that insight, Zinn’s team simply added a short video explaining that it was OK to ask parents for the password—and saw a rapid 10-fold increase in the sign-up rate for the app. By

while some countries are rich and have figured out ways to distribute their riches to some of their citizens, we would not consider them prosperous because their riches have not bred a culture of inquiry, innovation, and a diversity of markets. They have not led to socioeconomic mobility for all. And those resources have not led to an environment in which prosperity will become sustainable after those natural resources run dry or lose their value in the future. This illustrates the importance of understanding what creates poverty

Instead, we believe that for many countries prosperity typically begins to take root in an economy when we invest in a particular type of innovation—market-creating innovation—which often serves as a catalyst and foundation for creating sustained economic development.

The real breakthrough in human flight didn’t come from crafting better wings or using more feathers, even though those are good things. It was brought about by Dutch-Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli and his book Hydrodynamica, a study of fluid mechanics. In 1738, he outlined what was to become known as Bernoulli’s principle, a theory that, when applied to flight, explained the concept of lift

Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes

They are figuring out where they fit into the larger picture: Who is in charge? Is it okay to criticize someone’s idea? What are the rules here? Their interactions appear smooth, but their underlying behavior is riddled with inefficiency, hesitation, and subtle competition. Instead of focusing on the task, they are navigating their uncertainty about one another. They spend so much time managing status that they fail to grasp the essence of the problem (the marshmallow is relatively heavy, and the spaghetti is hard to secure). As a result, their first efforts often collapse, and they run out of time.

But what we see here gives us a window into a powerful idea. Safety is not mere emotional weather but rather the foundation on which strong culture is built. The deeper questions are, Where does it come from? And how do you go about building it?

The term we use to describe this kind of interaction is chemistry. When you encounter a group with good chemistry, you know it instantly.

As we speak, a river of data from the group’s performance is rolling across his computer screen, including the percentage of time each person spends talking, the energy levels of their voices, their speaking rates, the smoothness of turn taking, the number of interruptions, and the amount each person’s vocal pattern mimics the others. Lederman has captured this data using a small red plastic device the size of a credit card that contains a microphone, GPS, and an array of other sensors. The device is called a sociometer. It samples the data five times per second and wirelessly streams it to a server, where it is rendered into a series of graphs.

Future orientation: They signal the relationship will continue These cues add up to a message that can be described with a single phrase: You are safe here.

The key to creating psychological safety, as Pentland and Edmondson emphasize, is to recognize how deeply obsessed our unconscious brains are with it. A mere hint of belonging is not enough; one or two signals are not enough. We are built to require lots of signaling, over and over. This is why a sense of belonging is easy to destroy and hard to build.

In recent years, Pentland and his team have used sociometers to capture the interactions of hundreds of groups in post-op wards, call centers, banks, salary negotiations, and business pitch sessions. In each study, they discovered the same pattern: It’s possible to predict performance by ignoring all the informational content in the exchange and focusing on a handful of belonging cues.

Overall Pentland’s studies show that team performance is driven by five measurable factors: 1. Everyone in the group talks and listens in roughly equal measure, keeping contributions short. 2. Members maintain high levels of eye contact, and their conversations and gestures are energetic. 3. Members communicate directly with one another, not just with the team leader. 4. Members carry on back-channel or side conversations within the team. 5. Members periodically break, go exploring outside the team, and bring information back to share with the others.

“Collective intelligence is not that different in some ways than apes in a forest,” Pentland says. “One [ape] is enthusiastic, and that signal recruits others, and they jump in and start doing stuff together. That’s the way group intelligence works, and this is what people don’t get. Just hearing something said rarely results in a change in behavior. They’re just words. When we see people in our peer group play with an idea, our behavior changes. That’s how intelligence is created. That’s how culture is created

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has gained ground all over the world in treating anxiety and depression. Essentially, this talk therapy focuses on how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and behaviour. Negative thinking patterns can start in childhood. For example, if you didn’t receive much attention from your parents, as an adult you may automatically think ‘I’m just not good enough’ when things don’t go your way.

The result is that people with growth mindsets are open to changing their narrative. They keep an open mind regarding the possibility that they can gain the necessary skills to become tomorrow’s leaders, innovators and experts. We know that anyone can acquire new skills when they put their mind to it, so we should all try to develop a growth mindset by reminding ourselves of this.

Luck has no role for a person with an external locus of control. They believe only in talent and effort, and claim you ‘make your own luck’. Think about what that means for someone whose career faces a series of unexpected setbacks – for example, people who have lost their jobs because the economy has contracted. Lay-offs happen to talented people all the time. For those who are laid off and have an internal locus of control, internalizing the blame for this bad luck has a deteriorating effect on their well-being

In Happy Ever After: Escaping the Myth of the Perfect Life, Paul Dolan highlights the power of narratives and documents how the stories we tell ourselves can really harm us in areas of life such as marriage, the pursuit of happiness, and income. He argues that we are addicted to doing what is expected of us. We internalize these expectations and a narrative emerges of what we ‘ought to do’ in life, which may not resemble what will bring us joy. This narrative becomes part of us, regardless of whether we are suited to it.

Take Jerome. At twenty-four he decided he wanted to move from working as an analyst in banking into a job where he would get to write computer code for online games. What is really fantastic is that Jerome had a clear idea of what he wanted to do. The problem? He had never studied computer science, had never written a line of code in his life, and had no money in the bank to undertake a university degree. Undeterred, Jerome researched online programming courses. Over the next two years he set about teaching himself to code in JavaScript and Python, using free online resources. He did this religiously from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. every weekday, after he’d finished his dinner and gone on a two-mile jog. This was his process. This dedication to learning his new skill was difficult at first, but it soon became part of his new normal. Jerome is still on his journey – he hasn’t quite secured his dream job yet, but he is freelancing and writing code for a variety of clients.

You should commit to paying deliberate attention to expanding your external network at least once a month. But how do you go about meeting these people in the first place? First, loop back to the activities that you have identified your ME+ doing. Your external networking should give you opportunities to engage in these activities, or expose you to individuals who do them and are at the top of their game. Because you want to expand your network, any group event that you attend needs to have time to socialize before or after.

Flow happens when you become immersed in what you are doing and are ultra-productive. Time seems to fly. As described by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, flow is a mental state that is experienced when you are engaged in continuous learning activities that are challenging enough to fully engross you. The good news is that if you achieve flow you will enjoy a feeling of great joy and satisfaction. The other states recognized by Csikszentmihalyi are anxiety, apathy, arousal, boredom, control, relaxation and worry. None of these states promotes optimal learning, but in my experience you have to go through at least one in a session to get to the flow state. With practice, a period of ninety minutes should allow for both the transition into flow and some productive work to be done. Of course, sometimes you may be more distracted than usual. On those days, it may not happen for you. Don’t beat yourself up about it, just show up for yourself on another occasion as soon as you can

Ericsson also maintains that if you manage to get into the zone, you can expect to be tired afterwards. Why? Because you have been focusing so intensely it saps your energy. Therefore, ninety minutes is about all you can achieve in a session, regardless of how much free time you have.

It is how I managed to read 100+ books in 2018. You zone in on and remember items that interest you, and these can be saved for later if you wish to go deeper. It also helps build the narrative that you are a continuous learner. By engaging in distracted learning regularly, you are helping ingrain a new routine in your daily life. If repeated enough times as a small step, it becomes a habit. A new status quo emerges

I would still encourage you to try the insights, one by one. This allows you to consciously evaluate the success of each for you personally. If it works for you, keep doing it. If you see no benefits after one week, don’t bother with it any more and move on to the next insight. You don’t have to do them in order, either; go with what appeals most. This is called trial-and-error learning. You keep what works and discard the rest. I have carried out trial-and-error learning with great success. It has helped me manage my own attention span (or lack of) and therefore my time. I regularly treat myself like a behavioural science experiment. Okay, so it sounds a little odd, but the basic idea is that I take an insight from behavioural science and apply it to myself. I then sit down after seven days and assess if the change I made actually altered my behaviour in a direction I want. If it did, I continue with the change, monitoring how it affects my behaviour week to week, until it stops working. At this point I have adapted. The novelty has worn off. So I try something else.

What is the underlying cause of all of these planning failures? The planning fallacy – the recognition of which is owed to work by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky from 1979. The planning fallacy is the tendency of people to consistently underestimate the time that it will take them to do any activity, even if they have knowledge that similar activities have taken them longer than their estimates in the past. We are just too bloody optimistic about our productivity, and this spills over into how easy we think an activity is to complete. Consequently, the time we allocate to various activities is too low to allow us to complete them.

When we plan to do something, we assume that things will run smoothly. We assume that we will experience a best-case scenario, even when this has not transpired in the past. We assume zero procrastination, fatigue, distraction or interruption. And this optimism has a knock-on effect on our time allocation.

Let’s imagine that you enrol in an online course, and by the fourth lesson you are certain that the content does not interest you. Perhaps you expected something different, or you’re simply not engaged. So you ask yourself whether the course is the only pathway to get to where you need to be within the allocated time. The answer is ‘no’. You then attend the fifth lesson and are miserable the entire time. Should you take the time you have already spent on the course into account when weighing up the costs and benefits of continuing? The answer is ‘no’. If you did, you would be like someone in a restaurant who insists on finishing a meal even when their belly is full, just so they can ‘get their money’s worth’.

Take a moment to identify the meaning behind the work you have chosen for ME+ in terms of these two categories. Armed with this information, think of a skill that you have now, or a skill you are cultivating for ME+, that would allow you to do this meaningful work well. This exercise allows you to tap into authenticity and self-efficacy as mechanisms to increase the meaning of the work you intend ME+ to do. You gain authenticity by realizing that the skills you possess, or those you are working towards, allow you to carry out this meaningful work, which benefits you and/or others directly.

I provided evidence that finding meaning in one’s work can improve productivity, even for the most boring tasks, in a 2019 field experiment conducted with Alberto Salamone at a manufacturing firm in the US. The workers we studied were employed in jobs that involved very repetitive tasks. These jobs, to most people (including the workers themselves), would be described as ‘boring’. We put posters on their production floor on a random day, which made salient to these workers the meaning and importance of the job they were doing. There were three parts to each poster. The first was designed to recognize the workers’ own skill sets. The second was designed to emphasize the wider purpose of the product they were making – in this instance, we were reminding the workers that they manufactured the lights that keep people safe when they cross train tracks or drive on the road. The third component personalized the benefits of the product they made. We showed them the faces of the people they were helping to keep safe. Overall, our study showed that making the meaning of work salient through this three-step process hugely increased the intrinsic motivation of these workers, causing them to work longer hours and miss fewer days. At times of low motivation, it is worth visualizing the people who will gain from your future work – whether that is children you will teach, consumers who will be better off with the service you provide, colleagues who will gain from your fantastic leadership, or your family who will gain from you having a better work–life balance

Monitoring in this way works well for all kinds of things. For instance: Securing new clients for your food delivery business? Count the number of emails and telephone calls you make and follow up on. Compare this to the number that you intended to do. Doing small-business-related administration tasks such as tax returns, filing expenses and payroll? When setting intentions, make a list of all of these tasks and commit to doing a specific number per session, marking them off as you go.

Luck is random and very much outside your own control. It is being in the right place at the right time. I do like to distinguish fair luck (for example, winning the lottery) from luck that is determined by privilege (being born into a wealthy family). However, for the case of a post-mortem, you can combine luck and privilege because, just like luck, you did not choose your privilege.

You lose the cash or item of value you have committed. In practice, it can go to a charity, or you can even pledge to give to a cause that you really disagree with. For example, those who are anti-guns could promise to give money to the National Rifle Association, and those who are anti-hunting could pledge to donate to a hunting club. This may be more effective than promises of charitable giving. Why? Because to give money to a cause that you hate would mean you are acting in a way that is out of line with how you see yourself. Your ego helps ensure that you avoid doing this because if you did there would be an unpalatable psychological cost.

INSIGHT 1: REBALANCING IMMEDIATE COSTS AND BENEFITS The time you will devote to your small steps has a cost now, and the benefits are far in the future. Setting yourself carrots and sticks for achieving tasks can help you see these long-term costs and benefits in the present. INSIGHT 2: CULTIVATE SELF-BELIEF Take time to cultivate self-belief, safe in the knowledge that it is malleable. When starting difficult tasks, remind yourself that the uncertainty you may feel about your abilities is transitory, and will disappear if you keep taking small steps towards your big-thinking goal. INSIGHT 3: GIVE YOURSELF EXTRA TIME Scale up the timings you have suggested for individual tasks by 1.5, to allow yourself more time than you think you need. INSIGHT 4: RECOMMIT REGULARLY TO YOUR BIG-THINKING GOAL Set aside time regularly to bring your big-thinking goal into clear focus. Making salient the benefits of the time you are devoting to your new journey will mean it is more likely that you keep showing up. INSIGHT 5: MEANING IS A MOTIVATOR Identify the meaning of the work ME+ will do, and bring it to mind regularly to help you stay motivated. INSIGHT 6: WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS DONE Do regular post-mortems of the activities you have committed to, as this will help you assess and identify the obstacles that are holding you back. INSIGHT 7: LUCK VERSUS EFFORT When reflecting on how tasks have gone and whether you succeeded or failed, consider whether the outcome was shaped more by luck or effort. This allows you to see more clearly the occasions when your decision-making caused the outcome, versus factors outside your control. INSIGHT 8: MIND YOUR EMOTIONS When making decisions that will significantly affect your big-thinking journey, always do so with a cool head. This will give you the best opportunity of accurately assessing the long-term costs, benefits and risks, rather than acting on fleeting emotions. INSIGHT 9: IT’S NOT ALL OR NOTHING Consider creating high, medium and low workload aims for the activities you plan to do, so that when it comes to doing the task, you can complete the version that best matches your energy that day. Small progress is better than no progress. INSIGHT 10: ADD A STICK TO YOUR WEEKLY PLANNING If smaller carrots and sticks do not work to keep you on track, consider commitment devices, with a harder punishment like the loss of hard-earned cash or something else that is valuable.

INSIGHT 1: BIASES IN YOUR NETWORKS AND INFLUENCERS Back in 1998, as a dedicated student of computer science, I took to assignments in my Java programming course with gusto. Each one would begin with a project idea, given to us by a professor, that we would have to turn into a real-life object. I built simple games, designed automatic lighting, and more. To learn what we needed to know we had regular two-hour coding labs. I often devoted many hours to ensuring I had got my projects right. It was on one of those occasions, about midway through my first term, that I collared my professor at the end of class for extra help – something wasn’t working but I had no idea what was going wrong. We had been together

But if it’s easy to spot biases, why is it so hard to stop them from slowing down your progress? Many of these biases are engaged by System 1, your fast brain, at an unconscious level. So while it’s easy to understand that we all have biases, it’s not easy to stop ourselves from having them.

There is an intuitive reason why diverse teams are better problem-solvers, better at predicting the future, and more innovative.2 Their members have lived different lives, pursued different skill sets, and each of them has a different stock of knowledge. They do not all think the same way. They do not all repeat the same ideas. As a result, they can get to the front much quicker than teams with only one type of background, skill set or knowledge base.

One explanation offered by Mas and Moretti for the rise in productivity observed in the cashiers is social pressure. Social pressure can change behaviour, as it sets a new normal. There is a reason why children in school do better if put into classrooms with children who perform better than them. It’s the same reason why people are more likely to regularly exercise if they are part of a group. And it’s why we end up working later when we look around and see that our colleagues aren’t rushing to go home.

Traditionally, when teens begin dating, the majority of the time it is the boys that have the knee-wobbling job of asking a girl on a date.

This is a fantastic lesson that will result in some amazing benefits all the way through life.

TOP TIP: RESTACKING THE ODDS IN YOUR FAVOUR 1 Reframe putting yourself forward when there is an uncertain outcome. Remind yourself that the probability of success is positive. It may be low, but it is always positive. 2 Never focus on the outcome. Focus on your decision-making process. It is only your decision-making that you can control. 3 Remember that anticipating failure feels worse than failure itself. You will always learn something from the process, even if you fail. 4 Remind yourself that continued exposure to loss aversion will make you realize that losing isn’t as painful as you expected it to be.

These questions link to the well-established behavioural science concept of anchoring, in which people over-rely on pre-existing information when making decisions. So (to use the example of my shopping experience) a bag priced at £500 with 50 per cent off is perceived to be a better bargain than a bag originally tagged £250. It also explains why many of us jump online for those regular flash sales they have these days.

The curse of knowledge can also lead to something called the tiara syndrome. This is the expectation that if you work hard every day, a time will come when you are rewarded and someone will effectively put a tiara on your head. But the people who you are relying on to give you this reward are navigating their own paths in work. They are busy. Perhaps they themselves are beginning to think big. So it is up to you to draw attention to your value and your desire to move forward. It is always your responsibility to ask for what you need in terms of advice and guidance.

There is a reason why meta-analysis suggests that over one-third of feedback causes performance decreases.9 So if somebody says you do something poorly, don’t become overly focused on the fact that you do something poorly – concentrate instead on what steps you need to take to improve.

Why do people worry about what their neighbours will think if their marriage breaks down? Why do we find it hard to face our colleagues if we didn’t get promoted as planned?

Omission bias and action bias work in opposite ways.12 Omission bias causes us to judge activities that do us harm as much dumber than inactivity that harms us just as much.

Not taking action does not usually give us sleepless nights, as we have not taken any risks and have maintained the status quo. It is a form of psychological inertia. Standing still is preferred. In contrast, action bias can be summed up as ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ – we simply take action, whether or not it is the right decision.

There is nothing to react to if you stand still and the opportunities that come up over the course of your life simply slip away. Of course, you can’t say yes to everything either.

There’s a lot more to a PhD than most potential students realize. Including me. You have to find an academic voice, and contribute ideas that are creative enough to get published in international journals that are highly regarded. You need to communicate your ideas at public speaking events with large (often scathing) academic audiences. Depending on what you are studying, you may have to hone skills in data science, maths, deductive reasoning, interviewing, writing, communicating, teaching … the list goes on

At any one time, you know many people in the world. How each of those people views you differs. How do I know? It is easy to demonstrate, when you think about people in the public domain. Take Donald Trump. His presidency in the US has been plagued by contradictory narratives. Some people view him as a superhero, here to bring American jobs back to the US from far-flung shores. The ultimate warrior against globalization and the establishment. For others, Trump is an incompetent bully, crossing boundaries at every given opportunity and setting America back decades. These narratives, although totally contradictory, are held at the very same point in time by different people. They co-exist, and are espoused by the two sides as if they are facts. These narratives cause fights around dinner tables. These narratives divide nations.

So should you care if people differ in their opinion of you? As a flippant response, it is very easy to say ‘no’, you shouldn’t. Sod them! Why should you care about the sentiment of someone else when you have big thinking and small steps to be getting on with? You know who you are – and if they don’t see it, stuff them! But what if the person – or persons – with the biases and blind spots can influence your progress? What if they can derail your planning altogether? This can happen if the people who will review your work do not accurately see your skills, abilities and talents.

This is a pretty neat way to illustrate the potential for individuals to be treated differently because of visible aspects of themselves (for example, gender, race, age or presentation) that do not correlate with the things that actually matter: skills, ability and talent.

In times of scarcity all workers are more likely to rely on creating in-groups (an exclusive group of co-workers that share information, opportunities and comradeship) to keep them safe from losing their job. Quite often, in-groups are created around characteristics that have nothing to do with skills, ability or talent, so they are bad news for organizations. What is more, the creation of in-groups is often unconscious.

Evidence from behavioural science does suggest that those who do not fit the mould can make it, but they need to be better than those who do fit the mould by a decent amount. It is pretty awful to be advised simply to be more than twice as good to get the same opportunities. In fact, it is grossly unfair. There must be an easier way!

There is one big proviso. If you receive negative feedback and cannot see yourself in it (this can happen: everyone has an ego), get a second opinion. Ideally, get three. Why three? Because you need to figure out if it is your biases that are stopping you hearing legitimate feedback, or if the behavioural biases and blind spots of others are affecting what is being said. The three people should be as independent as possible from each other. That is, they should not know each other, or at least not converse regularly.

But what if the feedback of one person isn’t echoed by the other two? Discard it. You have experienced feedback that is tainted by behavioural biases and blind spots. If it is from somebody you can learn a lot from, it is fine to go back – but with a poop filter. The second time around you should not approach them. If the nay-sayer actually knocks on your door touting pearls of wisdom, ask them for facts to back up their words. Third time? Don’t answer the door.

At that point, confirmation bias steps in, ensuring that we search for and recall additional information in a way that confirms a particular belief we hold.

What does the fundamental attribution error mean for your big-thinking journey? It implies that if you get lucky, that luck is going to be attributed to you – with the knock-on effect that your journey is accelerated. On the flip side, this means that if you hit a bit of bad luck, the negative outcome could be attributed to you rather than the random event that caused it

TOP TIP: CIRCUMVENTING FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTION ERROR This isn’t easy, and relies on your communication skills. When you have bad luck, communicate how your outcome on this particular occasion was down to randomness rather than your skills and capabilities. If you are good at storytelling, you can wrap it up in an amusing anecdote. If not, stick to the facts and make clear you respect the other person’s time. Lightning doesn’t normally strike twice, so reassure your stakeholders that you are optimistic for a better outcome next time.

Did you assume that group decision-making would lead to better outcomes than decisions made by individuals? Two heads are better than one, right? If one person has a blind spot, it’s likely that the other person doesn’t and so cancels it out. You expect, then, that the outcome from a group would be greater than the sum of its parts. But for this to hold true, everyone needs to participate freely and have their voice heard. Everyone needs to be motivated by goals that are collective rather than individualistic. Empirical evidence from the lab and field suggests that this is not always the case.9 In fact, most of the time meetings are affected by groupthink.

One of the first major problems of groupthink is that it causes people to focus on shared information – as I experienced at that panel event – just so they can feel good about themselves. In the next meeting you are in, sit back and wait for the cascade. When we are in a group setting, it makes us feel good about ourselves to talk about things that are familiar to everyone at the table. There is no discomfort. No uncomfortable pauses. Everyone is on the same page. What does this imply for decision-making? You can have the most diverse and intellectual team in the world, but if they don’t reveal information that is unique to them as individuals, the quality of group discussions will be poor. Spending too much time in group discussions reiterating what is already known is clearly a waste of time. Focusing on well-known information may make us feel good about ourselves, but that is where the benefits end.

A 2004 paper by Joel Baum and Brian Silverman highlights that while venture capitalists are pretty good at picking certain winning traits, fundamental attribution error is alive and well. Specifically, it causes them to overestimate the human capital in the start-ups they back.

For example, let’s imagine you are making a product and a company in your supply chain is exposed for paying its workers below the minimum wage. You have done due diligence that you can easily demonstrate. However, your customers and investors will associate these types of practices with your company. This bad luck damages your reputation and loses you money when they stop backing you.

Assuming you know ahead of time the people who will be at the meeting, also make an effort to appeal to ego by personalizing your pitch to the tastes and preferences of the people in the room. If you are proposing something entirely radical that departs from shared information and viewpoints, this gives you the best chance of cutting though the groupthink.

One great tip for meeting leaders to break a cascade in their meeting is to call colleagues in random order (rather than allowing people to speak by raising their hand). If you aren’t leading the meeting and don’t have the luxury of choosing the order of speakers, you can still nudge who gets to speak after you.

If you aren’t leading the meeting and don’t have the luxury of choosing the order of speakers, you can still nudge who gets to speak after you. By relaying that you want to keep the conversation centred around your unique insights, you make the points you raised more salient. You also increase the likelihood that any subsequent cascade will be focused on information relevant to the topic discussed.

You could also go one step further. Let people know that because time is sensitive, after the meeting you would like to receive written feedback from the entire group. This serves two purposes. First, it allows for introverts and others who are not usually heard in meetings to become a real part of your discussion, giving you more diversity in the feedback that you receive. Second, if agreed by the chair, a decision won’t be made until the next meeting. Putting some time between raising a new idea which is counter to the cascade and when the option to ‘go with’ is chosen will take the emotion out of the decision and give your idea the biggest chance of success.

We are constantly being judged in many areas of our life … When we interview for a job. When we submit a piece of writing. When we give a public talk. When we pitch our best idea. When we debate, audition, speak up in a meeting, or even when we meet up for coffee with a colleague. In all these situations we are being watched, and someone else determines if we are successful. Someone else determines if we are to be taken seriously. Even if we come fully prepared, the process of judging is riddled with behavioural biases and blind spots. But can we tip the odds in our favour?

You can use the Barnum effect to help build a rapport with others. Why does it work? Simple. The Barnum effect appeals to ego. As humans we like to feel good about ourselves, and ego ensures that we give more time to people who enable that. This is the explanation given by Craig Landry and colleagues in their 2006 study, which found that male respondents give more to charity when approached by attractive females in door-to-door fundraising. The authors also suggest that the additional generosity was prompted by a need to sustain ego and a positive self-image.

You can also leverage commitment bias. If there is someone in a meeting you need a yes from and you sense the mood is right, put them on the spot for an answer. Commitment bias ensures that once someone has publicly committed to endorsing you, it is difficult for them to retreat from that support. Cognitive biases also ensure they will likely feel good about this endorsement. Win-win!

Psychological safety implies an environment where people are secure in the knowledge that when they speak up there will be no punishment or humiliation. But it is important that, when there are open events, others who do not identify as being part of the group show up. Why? If we only show up for the group we belong to, there will always be winners and losers, and unequal systems that reward characteristics that are unrelated to ability, skills and talent will continue to be rewarded. We should champion change in areas that we do not gain from, too. If enough of us take the time to learn about how other groups may be struggling, real change can happen.

FIVE FAB BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE CONCEPTS MENTIONED IN THIS CHAPTER 1 Unconscious biases: Learned stereotypes that are ingrained and which influence decision-making via System 1. 2 Tall poppy syndrome: The tendency for people to knock down others who are achieving great things. 3 Fundamental attribution error: This causes us to attribute a person’s behaviour to their identity rather than the situation. 4 Informational cascade: A phenomenon in which individuals make the same points in a meeting repeatedly. 5 Peak-end rule: Implies that people judge an experience based on their feelings at the peak (most intense point) and at the end.

context matters.1 How we behave is affected by the cues we experience on a moment-by-moment basis in our environment. We process these cues unconsciously. For example, people buy more French wine when French music is playing in a store, and more German wine when German music is playing.2 Why? The music acts as a subconscious cue, nudging a person towards a particular choice. But we are blissfully unaware of the cue.

learning a new skill, you need periods of time without interruptions. Even the briefest of interruptions – like responding to a beep on your phone – can derail flow and cause you to make mistakes when trying to concentrate on something challenging.3 Interruptions don’t just take up time in the moment. They also cause a need for more effort (and time) to return to the same level of flow you experienced prior to the interruption. Interruptions also negatively affect your well-being. They have been linked to irritability, depression and lower levels of job satisfaction across a variety of worker types and contexts.4 Everyone needs to have some time in their day that is in an environment free of interruptions.

It is something I do unconsciously. You may have a similar online addiction that you need to crack. It may not be a communication tool – it could be gaming, shopping or checking the news. So what can you do? Only allow access to your time-sinker from one device. And place that device out of your immediate environment when you need an interruption-free zone. Voila! You have mechanically engineered an interruption-free environment. And what happens next? Your System 1 (your fast brain) will begin to associate that device with the time-sinking activity, making it a new habit to engage in this way and reducing the likelihood that you unconsciously engage in your time-sinker via some other mechanism. This is what I did when I only allowed myself to check emails on my iPad. I also only engaged with social media and messaging on this iPad. I essentially decided to become a person who only engages in online communication once a day, via this iPad.

But I am much happier in less cluttered environments – and it is not just a matter of happiness. I am also better able to concentrate and more productive when my workspace is tidy. I can more easily put my hand on what I need. So I wasn’t surprised to see emerging evidence that links clutter to higher levels of distraction.

FIVE FAB BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE CONCEPTS MENTIONED IN THIS CHAPTER: 1 Context matters: The fact that how we behave is affected by the cues we experience on a moment-by-moment basis in our environment. 2 Nudging: Provides positive reinforcement that influences the behaviour of individuals. 3 Intent-action gap: The gap between what people say they are going to do and what they actually do. 4 Externality: A cost or benefit that affects a third party (who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit) because of another person’s actions or change in behaviour. 5 Endowment effect: Causes an emotional attachment to your possessions.

Why do we reach so quickly for the bozo justification when we are splashed? The answer is the fundamental attribution error. The act of the driver going through the puddle is being viewed as a reflection of the driver’s personality rather than simply the situation they are in. Next time, question your anger and the underlying assumption that this is a driver that just doesn’t give a rat’s behind. I’ll level with you: some drivers are bozos, and will take pleasure in soaking your cotton socks. However, an intensely negative reaction punishes you, and not the driver, by looming large over a portion of your day that would otherwise be productive

The Interrupter was a man who cared deeply about diversity and inclusion. He was annoyed at his firm for using box-checking exercises to avoid the tough conversations about what was happening in other teams. He cared about diversity and inclusion, and that was evident in his actions. He had lashed out in the meeting because he felt that its purpose was virtue signalling rather than a call for real action.

These are big gains from a small action. Simple expressions of gratitude can really pay dividends in beefing up resilience reserves. What is more, expressing gratitude has also been linked to lower levels of depression – as well as increased happiness and better self-esteem.2

Isaac Newton was the first to glimpse this secret of the universe. He found that the orbits of the planets, the rhythm of the tides, and the trajectories of cannonballs could all be described, explained, and predicted by a small set of differential equations. Today we call them Newton’s laws of motion and gravity. Ever since Newton, we have found that the same pattern holds whenever we uncover a new part of the universe. From the old elements of earth, air, fire, and water to the latest in electrons, quarks, black holes, and superstrings, every inanimate thing in the universe bends to the rule of differential equations. I bet this is what Feynman meant when he said that calculus is the language God talks. If anything deserves to be called the secret of the universe, calculus is it.

Finally, I thank all those who have encouraged me to write this book. While I have long taken part in policymaking, conversing with private and public decision-makers, as yet I had never engaged with the wider public. After receiving the Nobel Prize I was regularly asked by people I met in the street or as I gave talks to explain to a broader audience the nature of economic research and what it contributes to our well-being. They inquired about whether economists are useful, whether economics is a science, whether the key challenges we face can be solved. They made me aware of my responsibility to get out of my laboratory, describe my daily activity, and explain the logic and insights of economics—not to act as a commentator on each and every topic, but simply to share with the public my passion for the discipline and to explain how scientific knowledge can guide economic policies and help us understand the world we (will) live in.

We have already discussed the power of framing messages to other people in a positive way. For the small steps associated with your big-thinking goal, frame them as something that you ‘get to do’. Doing so is a natural way to instil gratitude for the opportunities that you have. Remind yourself that you are always moving forward, regardless how small your steps are, once you are routinely engaged in the activities you identified in Chapter 2. Remind yourself that getting to engage in these activities is something to be grateful for in and of itself.

We spend countless hours reading, listening to, and watching other people’s opinions about what we should do, how we should think, and how we should live, but make comparatively little effort applying that knowledge and making it our own. So much of the time we are “information hoarders,” stockpiling endless amounts of well-intentioned content that only ends up increasing our anxiety.

I had the misfortune of graduating into one of the worst job markets in a generation, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Faced with few employment opportunities in the United States, I decided to join the Peace Corps, an overseas volunteer program that sends Americans to serve in developing countries. I was accepted and assigned to a small school in the eastern Ukrainian countryside, where I would spend two years teaching English to students aged eight to eighteen.

I taught the older students the basics of personal productivity—how to keep a schedule, how to take notes in class, and how to set goals and plan their education. I will never forget their appreciation as they grew up and used those skills to apply to universities and succeed in their first jobs. Years later, I still regularly receive messages of gratitude as the productivity skills I taught my former students continue to bear fruit in their lives.

I started taking notes on everything I was learning using a notetaking app on my computer. I took notes during meetings, on phone calls, and while doing research online. I wrote down facts gleaned from research papers that could be used in the slides we presented to clients. I wrote down tidbits of insight I came across on social media, to share on our own social channels. I wrote down feedback from my more experienced colleagues so I could make sure I digested it and took it to heart. Every time we started a new project, I created a dedicated place on my computer for the information related to it, where I could sort through it all and decide on a plan of action.

early modern Englishmen read in fits and starts and jumped from book to book. They broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them in different sections of their notebooks. Then they reread the copies and rearranged the patterns while adding more excerpts. Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality

Then, it can become dangerous — dangerous in the sense that one can easily make a concept out of this. It can create false notions in a person’s mind, i.e. without knowing anything, he will think that he knows it all.

In the bhajan you sing, ‘Chita chora’ which means ‘You are a thief.’ You are telling Krishna, ‘You are a thief. You have stolen my mind, my heart; you have stolen everything!’ ‘Navanita chora Gopal’. Navanita means one whose mind is like butter, who is in the present moment; not like a rock, but very soft. Their heart and mind has become very soft. You even steal such people who are unattached to anything. You get them attached to you. Even the detached, and the recluse mind can be captivated by the charm of the Divine.

So only when a question is asked, should one answer. And it should be asked in a proper way. Do not answer, do not talk or say anything if it is not asked for. And do not answer if it is not asked for in the proper way with all humility. One cannot demand answers. If someone does demand, never answer them. Be silent. A demanding person has no ear. They have removed their ears and kept it aside like dentures. When a person is demanding an answer, he has detached his ears and he is just asking a question. That question is not coming from a seeking mind, but from some anguish, problem or pain. The law says that then you should not answer. You should just smile and not answer the question if it is not asked at the proper time. Never answer a question if the time or place is not right.

You have to take a son or daughter to school or get them married, or a small business or job, whatever... We get so involved in small things. A responsibility is given, but we get so totally entangled in it! Think of a king on whom the entire state is depending and looking up to. He has to take care of the whole society, the entire nation’s welfare! He is responsible for everything that happens in that country. How can he be detached and be at peace? He may be living in a golden palace, decorated with gold and wearing very valuable jewels; he may have everything at his beck and call but he cannot have a feeling of detachment. This is most beautiful. Someone who does not have any responsibility can feel very detached. But that freedom has no value. If someone who is responsible for the whole society, the whole kingdom can say that he is not doing anything inspite of his responsible job; then that ‘not doing something’ is great. That is enlightenment.

If we can cultivate even a small fraction of his clarity and objectivity in thought, we are bound to make better decisions. This aspect of Rāma needs more focus and discussion. I hope I have been able to bring that out in the book. That, at least, has been my intention.

For Swift, writing songs is not a discrete activity that she can do only at certain times and in certain places. It is a side effect of the way her mind works, spinning off new metaphors and turns of phrase at the most unexpected times: “I’m inspired to write songs at any time of day, when I’m going through something or when the dust has settled and I’m over it. It can be anything. I’ll just be doing dishes or something, or in the middle of an interview, and I could get an idea in my head that just kind of sticks out as, ‘That could be a hook, that could be a pre-chorus, that’s a first line.’ ” She goes on to explain why it’s so important to her to capture those fleeting

Quality and capacity of administrative apparatus is considered the backbone of South Korea’s developmental administration. South Korea’s developmental administration was formulated and highly activated in the Park Chung-hee regime, which led to rapid economic growth with strong and effective interventionist industrial policies while it maintained an authoritarian political system and basically rejected citizens’ call for democratization for the sake of political stability (Moon 2016).

Starting in the Chosun Dynasty, the Confucian tradition dictated that educated and intellectual elites serve the country as well as that they become public officials/moral leaders when they were called, not for individual prestige but for family nobility and loyalty to the king (Frederickson 2002; Im et al. 2013; Moon and Hwang 2018). This Confucian tradition helped to firmly establish the merit-based recruitment system that began formally with the National Civil Service Act of 1963, inspiring and motivating capable young people to go into public office and helping to make South Korea relatively immune from the destructive nepotism which is a major obstacle for many developing countries (Moon 2016). However, increasing competition and excessive interest in the public service examination also entail social problems such as the misallocation of human resources at the national level.

The book begins with the basics: how to develop a professional style, get started on a piece of writing, create a first draft, and edit it into a strong final product. It then offers advice on more than a dozen forms of writing, from a one-line tweet to a lengthy report, using concrete examples and templates. The book also provides guidance on how formal or informal to allow your language to be, and how to strike the right tone so your message gets heard. Throughout, it emphasizes the “bottom line up front” approach used by the US military to ensure efficient communications. The goal is to help you write effectively on the job—and enjoy doing it!

Have you backed up your arguments? Have you been clear when you are pivoting from stating facts to offering your opinion?

Such a happy, prosperous, virtuous, just, inclusive and peaceful society can only exist when the state has some necessary characteristics. These are: ✦ The state has governance systems tuned to the needs and aspirations of its people. ✦ The state provides enough wealth creation opportunities to everyone. ✦ There is a correct balance between rights and responsibilities, regulations and individual freedom, that allows everyone to not just survive but grow and thrive while maintaining order in the society. ✦ There are effective and timely justice dispensation mechanisms. ✦ The administration is focused on the welfare of every part of the society equally, without exploiting any segment. ✦ The state preserves its natural resources and respects the laws of nature. In such a state nature, too, remains bountiful. In essence, Rāma Rājya was a perfect, well-governed state owing to Rāma’s administrative acumen and keen understanding of dharma

At 37signals, we build products we need to run our own business. For example, we wanted a way to keep track of whom we talked to, what we said, and when we need to follow up next. So we created Highrise, our contact-management software. There was no need for focus groups, market studies, or middlemen. We had the itch, so we scratched it.

Inventor James Dyson scratched his own itch. While vacuuming his home, he realized his bag vacuum cleaner was constantly losing suction power—dust kept clogging the pores in the bag and blocking the airflow. It wasn’t someone else’s imaginary problem; it was a real one that he experienced firsthand. So he decided to solve the problem and came up with the world’s first cyclonic, bagless vacuum cleaner.

Invite as few people as possible. Always have a clear agenda. Begin with a specific problem. Meet at the site of the problem instead of a conference room. Point to real things and suggest real changes. End with a solution and make someone responsible for implementing it

After all, you might argue, we are now so sophisticated and technologically advanced, so progressive and enlightened; we have moved well beyond our primitive roots; we are in the process of rewriting our nature. But the truth is in fact the opposite—we have never been more in the thrall of human nature and its destructive potential than now. And by ignoring this fact, we are playing with fire.

This should not upset you but liberate you. The book will teach you to stop taking personally their insinuating comments, shows of coldness, or moments of irritation. The more you grasp this, the easier it will be to react not with your emotions but rather with the desire to understand where their behavior might come from. You will feel much calmer in the process. And as this takes root in you, you will be less prone to moralize and judge people; instead you will accept them and their flaws as part of human nature. People will like you all the more as they sense this tolerant attitude in you.

Our natural response to reading or hearing about the darker qualities in human nature is to exclude ourselves. It is always the other person who is narcissistic, irrational, envious, grandiose, aggressive, or passive-aggressive. We almost always see ourselves as having the best intentions. If we go astray, it is the fault of circumstances or people forcing us to react negatively. The Laws will make you stop once and for all this self-deluding process. We are all cut from the same cloth, and we all share the same tendencies. The sooner you realize this, the greater your power will be in overcoming these potential negative traits within you.

Cultivating such empathy will have innumerable benefits. We are all self-absorbed, locked in our own worlds. It is a therapeutic and liberating experience to be drawn outside ourselves and into the world of another. It is what attracts us to film and any form of fiction, entering the minds and perspectives of people so different from ourselves. Through this practice your whole way of thinking will shift. You are training yourself to let go of preconceptions, to be alive in the moment, and to continually adapt your ideas about people.

We can say that we humans have two contrary selves within us—a lower and a higher. The lower tends to be stronger. Its impulses pull us down into emotional reactions and defensive postures, making us feel self-righteous and superior to others. It makes us grab for immediate pleasures and distractions, always taking the path of least resistance. It induces us to adopt what other people are thinking, losing ourselves in the group. We feel the impulses of the higher self when we are drawn out of ourselves, wanting to connect more deeply with others, to absorb our minds in our work, to think instead of react, to follow our own path in life, and to discover what makes us unique. The lower is the more animal and reactive side of our nature, and one that we easily slip into. The higher is the more truly human side of our nature, the side that makes us thoughtful and self-aware. Because the higher impulse is weaker, connecting to it requires effort and insight.

The above story forces us to distinguish between being intelligent vs being prudent. What is intelligence? Intelligence is the ability to be a quick learner. Somebody could be highly intelligent, but may have poor judgment. Optimism and pessimism are both expectations—either positive or negative. Many times, positive or negative expectations sub-consciously, turn out to be self fulfilling prophecies.

First, those who manage well the circumstances which they encounter day by day; and those who can judge situations appropriately as they arise and rarely miss the suitable course of action. Next, those who are honorable in their dealings with all men, bearing easily what is unpleasant or offensive in others and being as reasonable with their associates as is humanly possible. Furthermore, those who hold their pleasures always under control and are not unduly overcome by their misfortunes, bearing up under them bravely and in a manner worthy of our common nature. Most important of all, those who are not spoiled by their successes, who do not desert their true selves, but hold their ground steadfastly as wise and sober-minded men, rejoicing no more in the good things that have come to them through chance than in those which through their own nature and intelligence are theirs since birth. Those who have a character which is in accord, not with one of these things, but with all of them, these are educated— possessed of all the virtues. – Socrates (470–399 B.C.)

In a nutshell, educated persons are those who choose wisely and courageously under any circumstances. If they choose between wisdom over foolishness, good over bad, virtue over vulgarities, regardless of the academic degrees they have, then they are uneducated. Educated people recognise their limitations but focus on their strengths.

’Progressive’ means that success is a journey, not a destination. It’s an ongoing process. We never arrive. After we reach one goal, we go on to the next and the next and so on. ’Realisation’ means it is an experience. Outside forces cannot make me feel successful. I have to feel it within myself. It is internal not external. That is why what often appears success externally may be total hollowness internally. No wonder we hear of some celebrities and billionaires taking drugs and committing suicide because they feel emptiness internally. ’Worthiness’ determines the quality of our journey. Can people have unworthy goals in their lives? The answer is, Yes! What makes a goal worthy? It is our value system which determines the quality of our journey. Whenever we talk of values, whose values are we talking about and who are we to judge? We talk of universal values and eternal values. Universal values mean that they cut across countries, cultures and religions. Eternal means, they were here before we came and they will be here after we’re gone.

I see success as a manifestation of good luck that results from aspiration, inspiration and perspiration—generally in that sequence. THE WINNING EDGE In order to get the winning edge, we need to strive for excellence, not perfection. Striving for perfection is neurotic; striving for excellence is progress. Excellence is continuous improvement. There is nothing that cannot be done better or improved the next time. All that we need is a little edge. At the race course, the winning horse that comes first may win with three to one, five to one or ten to one depending on the odds and betting. The question is whether the winning horse that wins ten to one, is ten times faster than the next one? The answer is, absolutely not. He may only be faster by a fraction, by a nose, but the rewards are ten times greater. Is it fair? Who cares? It does not matter. Those are the rules of the game. Whatever happens with the horses at the race course, is also true in our human lives. The question is, do we have to be ten times smarter than the competition? Absolutely not. All we need is the nose and the rewards are ten times bigger.

Many times you hear, don’t work hard, work smart. What does working smart mean? It means: 1) learning from other people’s mistakes because our lives are not long enough to make all of our own mistakes. 2) We need to find a process or way to accelerate to achieve our goals or destination. Acceleration means speeding up the process rather than bypassing the process. Working smart does not mean compromising values. The key to succeed in life is to work both smart and hard.

All successful people gained success because they persisted. Calvin Coolidge said: “Nothing will take the place of persistence. Talent will not: Nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not: Unrewarded genius is a proverb. Education will not: The world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.”

DON’T QUIT When things go wrong, As they sometimes will, When the road you’re trudging seems all uphill, When the funds are low and the debts are high, And you want to smile, but you have to sigh, When care is pressing you down a bit—Rest if you must, but don’t you quit. Life is queer with its twists and turns, As every one of us sometimes learns, And many a failure turns about When he might have won had he stuck it out. Don’t give up though the pace seems slow—You may succeed with another blow. Success is failure turned inside out—The silver tint of the clouds of doubt, And you never can tell how close you are, It may be near when it seems so far; So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit It’s when things seem worst that you must not quit. – Anonymous

Fritz Kreisler, the great violinist, was once asked, “How do you play so well? Are you lucky?” He replied, “It is practice. If I don’t practice for a month, the audience can tell the difference. If I don’t practice for a week, my wife can tell the difference. If I don’t practice for a day, I can tell the difference.” What is the moral of the story? Persistence, hard work and pride in performance are inseparable.

Responsible risk-taking is based on knowledge, training, and competence—factors that give you the confidence and courage to act while facing fear. The person who never attempts anything risky makes no mistakes. However, not making the attempt is often a bigger mistake than making the attempt and failing.

RISKS To laugh is to risk appearing the fool. To weep is to risk appearing sentimental. To reach out for another is to risk involvement. To expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self. To place your ideas, your dreams, before a crowd is to risk their loss. To love is to risk not being loved in return. To live is to risk dying. To hope is to risk despair. To try is to risk failure. But risks must be taken, because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, and is nothing. – Janet Rand

The Easier Way May Actually Be The Tougher Way Once there was a lark singing in the forest. A farmer came by with a box full of worms. The lark stopped him and asked, “What do you have in the box and where are you going?” The farmer replied that he had worms and that he was going to the market to trade them for some feathers. The lark said, “I have many feathers. I will pluck one and give it to you and that will save me looking for worms.” The farmer gave the worms to the lark and the lark plucked a feather and gave it in return. The next day the same thing happened and the day after and on and on until a day came that the lark had no more feathers. Now it could no longer fly to go hunting for worms. It started looking ugly and stopped singing and very soon it died

People do things for their own reasons, not yours. This is illustrated by a story about Ralph Waldo Emerson. He and his son were once struggling to get a calf into the barn. Both father and son were exhausted, pulling and pushing. A little girl was passing by. She put her little finger into the calf’s mouth, allowing it to suck, and the calf lovingly followed her to the barn.

When we feel good the world looks nice, productivity goes up and relationships are a lot better. The reverse is just as true. Self-image is the way we see ourselves. Our opinion of ourselves critically influences everything, in every walk of life. High self-esteem is driven by self-acceptance and self worth whereas low self-esteem is driven by fear and self-doubt. Self-esteem comes from recognising and accepting your self-worth.

He grabbed a bunch of pencils, and said, “I will take some pencils. They are priced right. After all, you are a business person and so am I,” and he dashed back on to the train.

When people fail in any particular event, most get so disheartened that they start looking at themselves as failures, not realising that failing does not equal failure. I might have failed but that does not mean that I am a failure. I might have been fooled but that does not mean I am a fool.

Discipline is loving firmness. It is direction. It is prevention before a problem arises. It is a track to run on. It is harnessing and channeling energy for great performance. Discipline is not something you do to others, but something you do for those you care about.

Discipline is an act of love. Sometimes you have to be unkind to be kind: Not all medicines are sweet, nor all surgeries painless, but we have to take them. We need to learn from nature. We are all familiar with that big animal, the giraffe. A mother giraffe gives birth to a baby giraffe standing. All of a sudden, the baby falls on a hard surface from the cushion of his mother’s womb onto the ground. The first thing the mother does is to get behind the baby and give it a hard kick. The baby gets up, but the legs are weak and wobbly, and the baby falls down. The mother goes behind the baby again and gives one more kick. The baby gets up but falls down again.

Because she knows that the only chance of survival for the baby is to get on its feet, otherwise it will be eaten up by predators.

A boy was flying a kite with his father and asked him what kept the kite up. Dad replied, “The string.” The boy said, “Dad, it is the string that is holding the kite down.” The father asked his son to watch as he broke the string. Guess what happened to the kite? It came down. Isn’t that true in life? Sometimes the things that we think are holding us down are the very things that are helping us fly. That is what discipline is all about.

There is a story about an ancient Indian sage who was abused and called ugly names by an angry passerby. The sage listened unperturbed till the man ran out of words. The student of the sage got rather perturbed and asked the sage, “Why did you not give him a befitting reply?” The sage asked the student, “If an offering is not accepted, who does it belong to?” The student replied, “It belongs to the person who offered it.” The sage said, “I refused to accept his offering,” and the sage walked away calmly, leaving the student dazed. The sage was internally driven.

In China there is a bamboo tree that is planted, watered and fertilised for the first four years and nothing happens. There is no visible sign of growth. But sometime during the fifth year, the bamboo tree grows about ninety feet in six weeks. The question is: Did the bamboo tree grow in six weeks or did it take five years to grow? If the bamboo had not received water and fertiliser during the four years, when there was no visible sign of growth, would the plant have flourished? No. The bamboo tree would have died. The lesson is clear. Have patience and faith and keep doing the right thing. Even though the results may not be visible, something is happening.

This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It was simply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.

When you are trying to master a new field of knowledge, the ability to links ideas together is more important than the ability to read or remember a piece of information. You should investigate complex ways of chunking data and linking all the pieces of data you have together. You should also prioritize and distinguish what to focus on and what is “nice to have.” Most importantly, every time you read something completely new, pause a bit to process the information: creating great links takes time and creative effort.

In September 2011, our company, Notion, was brought in to work with Royal Mail, the United Kingdom’s postal service. At this point, they’d already put 2,800 of their managers through a two-day training programme to teach them manager as coach skills. The programme had received lots of praise from appreciative learners, but the organisation hadn’t detected any measurable behavioural or organisational change—no sustainable impact on performance, despite the significant investment. When we conducted interviews across the organisation to understand what had prevented them from incorporating the skills they’d recently learned, the answer was unanimous: “I’ve got no time for this. The course was great, but we’re busy, and we’ve got to get the mail out.” They were right, of course. As a specialist performance consultancy, we’d heard the same from managers across other corporate clients we were working with.

By the end of World War II, however, that rate had already accelerated to a doubling of world knowledge once every twenty-five years.

To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” —BUCKMINSTER FULLER designer, author, inventor Of course, we haven’t all been doing nothing while all of this change has been happening around us. There’s been an unquestionable rise in the popular interest in psychology and neuroscience as more and more research about how our brains work reveals newer insights about how we relate to each other and what drives our behaviour. Courses on resilience, mindfulness, and well-being abound as the training sector seeks to offer solutions to the rising levels of workplace stress by feeding us new insights so that we can continue to develop our Frankenstein management personas. But in and of themselves, these courses, while offering help to maintain some semblance of balance, aren’t enabling a revolution in releasing human potential.

To begin to address changing our behaviour, we need to recognise how we typically respond in different situations. If people come to us with problems, and we continually solve them, guess what? They’ll keep bringing us more problems. Not only are we doing the thinking at that moment (us doing the work), we’re almost certainly adding to our work stack in some other ways as some elements will end up remaining with us. However, if we start to gently and subliminally indicate to the other person that we believe they have it within them to answer those questions themselves and can help them to take action to resolve the issue, not only does it build their confidence, but they quickly begin to change their behaviour too.

What does someone who cannot read make of a health insurance product that doesn’t cover a lot of unpronounceable diseases? It means going to vote when your entire experience of the political system is a lot of promises, not delivered; and not having anywhere safe to keep your money, because what the bank manager can make from your little savings won’t cover his cost of handling it.

Throughout, the book returns to the same basic questions. Are there ways for the poor to improve their lives, and what is preventing them from being able to do these things? Is it more the cost of getting started, or is it easy to get started but harder to continue? What makes it costly? Do people sense the nature of the benefits? If not, what makes it hard for them to learn them?

It helps us understand, for example, why microfinance is useful without being the miracle some hoped it would be; why the poor often end up with health care that does them more harm than good; why children of the poor can go to school year after year and not learn anything; why the poor don’t want health insurance. And it reveals why so many magic bullets of yesterday have ended up as today’s failed ideas.

Poor countries are poor because they are hot, infertile, malaria infested, often landlocked; this makes it hard for them to be productive without an initial large investment to help them deal with these endemic problems. But they cannot pay for the investments precisely because they are poor—they are in what economists call a “poverty trap.” Until something is done about these problems, neither free markets nor democracy will do very much for them. This is why foreign aid is key: It can kick-start a virtuous cycle by helping poor countries invest in these critical areas and make them more productive.

The resulting higher incomes will generate further investments; the beneficial spiral will continue. In his bestselling 2005 book, The End of Poverty, 4 Sachs argues that if the rich world had committed $195 billion in foreign aid per year between 2005 and 2025, poverty could have been entirely eliminated by the end of this period.

Rwanda, for example, received a lot of aid money in the years immediately after the genocide, and prospered. Now that the economy is thriving, President Paul Kagame has started to wean the country off aid. Should we count Rwanda as an example of the good that aid can do (as Sachs suggests), or as a poster child for self-reliance (as Moyo presents it)? Or both?

To shed light on this debate, we need to answer three questions. First, if people must pay full price (or at least a significant fraction of the price) for a bed net, will they prefer to go without? Second, if bed nets are given to them free or at some subsidized price, will people use them, or will they be wasted? Third, after getting the net at subsidized price once, will they become more or less willing to pay for the next one if the subsidies are reduced in the future?

When we learn about whether poor people are willing to pay money for bed nets, and whether they use them if they get them for free, we learn about much more than the best way to distribute bed nets: We start to understand how poor people make decisions. For example, what stands in the way of more widespread bed net adoption? It could be a lack of information about their benefits, or the fact that poor people cannot afford them.

It could also be that the poor are so absorbed by the problems of the present that they don’t have the mental space to worry about the future, or there could be something entirely different going on. Answering these questions, we get to understand what, if anything, is special about the poor: Do they just live like everyone else, except with less money, or is there something fundamentally different about life under extreme poverty? And if it is something special, is it something that could keep the poor trapped in poverty

Is it possible to get trapped in poverty? Sachs, we know, believes that some countries, because of geography or bad luck, are trapped in poverty: They are poor because they are poor. They have the potential to become rich but they need to be dislodged from where they are stuck and set on the way to prosperity, hence Sachs’s emphasis on one big push.

On a video they produced for MTV, Jeffrey Sachs and actress Angelina Jolie visited Sauri, in Kenya, one of the oldest millennium villages. There they met Kennedy, a young farmer. He was given free fertilizer, and as a result, the harvest from his field was twenty times what it had been in previous years. With the savings from that harvest, the video concluded, he would be able to support himself forever. The implicit argument was that Kennedy was in a poverty trap in which he could not afford fertilizer: The gift of fertilizer freed him. It was the only way he could escape from the trap.

So is Kennedy trapped in poverty, or is he not? The answer depends on whether the strategy is feasible: Buy just a little to start with, make a little extra money, and then reinvest the proceeds, to make even more money, and repeat. But maybe fertilizer is not easy to buy in small quantities.

One could think of many reasons why a farmer might find it difficult to get started on his own.

For those who believe in poverty traps, the world looks like Figure 1. Your income today influences what your income will be in the future (the future could be tomorrow, next month, or even the next generation): What you have today determines how much you eat, how much you have to spend on medicine or on the education of your children, whether or not you can buy fertilizer or improved seeds for your farm, and all this determines what you will have tomorrow.

The lack of a grand universal answer might sound vaguely disappointing, but in fact it is exactly what a policy maker should want to know—not that there are a million ways that the poor are trapped but that there are a few key factors that create the trap, and that alleviating those particular problems could set them free and point them toward a virtuous cycle of increasing wealth and investment.

However, we had two advantages over the previous generations: First, there are now high-quality data from a number of poor countries that were not available before. Second, we have a new, powerful tool: randomized control trials (RCTs), which give researchers, working with a local partner, a chance to implement large-scale experiments designed to test their theories. In an RCT, as in the studies on bed nets, individuals or communities are randomly assigned to different “treatments”—different programs or different versions of the same program. Since the individuals assigned to different treatments are exactly comparable (because they were chosen at random), any difference between them is the effect of the treatment.

In order to design effective policy, it is crucial that we get answers to such questions right. We will see many instances in the chapters that follow where the wrong policy was chosen, not out of bad intentions or corruption, but simply because the policy makers had the wrong model of the world in mind: They thought there was a poverty trap somewhere and there was none, or they were ignoring another one that was right in front of them.

We believe that when taken together, these super models will be useful to you across your entire life: to make sense of situations, help generate ideas, and aid in decision making. For these mental models to be most useful, however, you must apply them at the right time and in the right context. And for that to happen, you must know them well enough to associate the right ones with your current circumstances. When you deeply understand a mental model, it should come to you naturally, like multiplication does. It should just pop into your head.

Carl Jacobi was a nineteenth-century German mathematician who often used to say, “Invert, always invert” (actually he said, “Man muss immer umkehren,” because English wasn’t his first language). He meant that thinking about a problem from an inverse perspective can unlock new solutions and strategies. For example, most people approach investing their money from the perspective of making more money; the inverse approach would be investing money from the perspective of not losing money. Or consider healthy eating. A direct

Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.

Any science or math teacher worth their salt stresses the importance of knowing how to derive every formula that you use, because only then do you really know it. It’s the difference between being able to attack a math problem with a blank sheet of paper and needing a formula handed to you to begin with. It’s also the difference between being a chef—someone who can take ingredients and turn them into an amazing dish without looking at a cookbook—and being the kind of cook who just knows how to follow a recipe.

Unfortunately, people often make the mistake of doing way too much work before testing assumptions in the real world. In computer science this trap is called premature optimization, where you tweak or perfect code or algorithms (optimize) too early (prematurely). If your assumptions turn out to be wrong, you’re going to have to throw out all that work, rendering it ultimately a waste of time.

Conjunction Fallacy Overfitting occurs when you use an overly complicated explanation when a simpler one will do. It’s what happens when you don’t heed Ockham’s razor, when you get sucked into the conjunction fallacy or make a similar unforced error. It can occur in any situation where an explanation introduces unnecessary assumptions. As a visual example, the data depicted on the next page can be easily explained by a straight line, but you could also overfit the data by creating a curved one that moves through every single point, as the wavy line does.

Essentially, the old guard holds on to the old theories way too long, even in the face of an obvious-in-hindsight alternative. Nobel Prize–winning physicist Max Planck explained it like this in his Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it,” or, more succinctly, “Science progresses one funeral at a time.”

We now know this to be the case—all of our continents were previously grouped together into one supercontinent now called Pangea. However, his theory was met with harsh criticism because Wegener was an outsider—a meteorologist by training instead of a geologist—and because he couldn’t offer an explanation of the mechanism causing continental drift, just the idea that it likely had taken place. It basically sat uninvestigated by mainstream geologists for forty years, until the new science of paleomagnetism started creating additional data in support of it, reviving the theory. The major theory that held during this time was that there must have been narrow land bridges (called Gondwanian bridges) sometime in the past that allowed the animals to cross between continents, even though there was never any concrete evidence of their existence. Instead of helping to investigate Wegener’s theory (which certainly wasn’t perfect but had promise), geologists chose to hold on to this incorrect land bridge theory until the evidence for continental drift was so overwhelming that a paradigm shift occurred.

The work of Ignaz Semmelweis, a nineteenth-century Hungarian doctor, met a similar fate. He worked at a teaching hospital where doctors routinely handled cadavers and also delivered babies, without appropriately washing their hands in between. The death rate of mothers who gave birth in this part of the hospital was about 10 percent! In another part of the same hospital, where babies were mostly delivered by midwives who did not routinely handle cadavers, the comparable death rate was 4 percent. Semmelweis obsessed about this difference, painstakingly eliminating all variables until he was left with just one: doctors versus midwives. After studying doctor behavior, he concluded that it must be due to their handling of the cadavers and instituted a practice of washing hands with a solution of chlorinated lime. The death rate immediately dropped to match that in the other part of the hospital. Despite the clear drop in the death rate, his theories were completely rejected by the medical community at large. In part, doctors were offended by the idea that they were killing their patients. Others were so hung up on the perceived deficiencies of Semmelweis’s theoretical explanation that they ignored the empirical evidence that the handwashing was improving mortality. After struggling to get his ideas adopted, Semmelweis went crazy, was admitted to an asylum, and died at the age of forty-seven. It took another twenty years after his death for his ideas about antiseptics to start to take hold, following Louis Pasteur’s unquestionable confirmation of germ theory.

Their reputations aren’t at stake if they question the status quo. They are by definition “free thinkers” because they are free to think without these constraints.

When our scale delivers good news, we smile and head for the shower. By uncritically accepting evidence when it pleases us, and insisting on more when it doesn’t, we subtly tip the scales in our favor.

Most people are binary and instant in their judgments; that is, they immediately categorize things as good or bad, true or false, black or white, friend or foe. A truly effective leader, however, needs to be able to see the shades of gray inherent in a situation in order to make wise decisions as to how to proceed. The essence of thinking gray is this: don’t form an opinion about an important matter until you’ve heard all the relevant facts and arguments, or until circumstances force you to form an opinion without recourse to all the facts (which happens occasionally, but much less frequently than one might imagine). F. Scott Fitzgerald once described something similar to thinking gray when he observed that the test of a first-rate mind is the ability to hold two opposing thoughts at the same time while still retaining the ability to function.

This model is powerful because it forces you to be patient. By delaying decision making, you avoid confirmation bias since you haven’t yet made a decision to confirm! It can be difficult to think gray because all the nuance and different points of view can cause cognitive dissonance. However, it is worth fighting through that dissonance to get closer to the objective truth.

The root cause, by contrast, is what you might call the real reason something happened. People’s explanations for their behavior are no different: anyone can give you a reason for their behavior, but that might not be the real reason they did something. For example, consistent underperformers at work usually have a plausible excuse for each incident, but the real reason is something more fundamental, such as lack of skills, motivation, or effort.

One technique commonly used in postmortems is called 5 Whys, where you keep asking the question “Why did that happen?” until you reach the root causes. Why did the Challenger’s hydrogen tank ignite? Hot gases were leaking from the solid rocket motor. Why was hot gas leaking? A seal in the motor broke. Why did the seal break? The O-ring that was supposed to protect the seal failed. Why did the O-ring fail? It was used at a temperature outside its intended range. Why was the O-ring used outside its temperature range? Because on launch day, the temperature was below freezing, at 29 degrees Fahrenheit. (Previously, the coldest launch had been at 53 degrees.) Why did the launch go forward when it was so cold? Safety concerns were ignored at the launch meeting. Why were safety concerns ignored? There was a lack of proper checks and balances at NASA. That was the root cause, the real reason the Challenger disaster occurred.

As you can see, you can ask as many questions as you need in order to get to the root cause—five is just an arbitrary number. Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman was on the Rogers Commission, agreeing to join upon specific request even though he was then dying of cancer. He uncovered the organizational failure within NASA and threatened to resign from the commission unless its report included an appendix consisting of his personal thoughts around root cause, which reads in part: It appears that there are enormous differences of opinion as to the probability of a failure with loss of vehicle and of human life. The estimates range from roughly 1 in 100 to 1 in 100,000. The higher figures come from the working engineers, and the very low figures from management. . . . It would appear that, for whatever purpose, be it for internal or external consumption, the management of NASA exaggerates the reliability of its product, to the point of fantasy. . . . For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.

As you can see from these examples, it is usually difficult to exclude people from using public goods, because they are broadly available (public). Since one person’s use does not significantly reduce a public good’s availability to others, it might seem as though there is no harm in free-riding. However, if enough people free-ride on a public good, then it can degrade to the point of creating a tragedy of the commons.

the public good is a disease-free environment due to herd immunity, and the free riders are those who take advantage of this public good by not getting vaccinated. The tyranny of small decisions can arise when enough individuals choose not to get vaccinated, resulting in an outbreak of the disease, creating a tragedy of the commons.

Herd immunity as a concept is useful beyond the medical context. It applies directly in maintaining social, cultural, business, and industry norms. If enough infractions are left unchecked, their incidence can start increasing quickly, creating a new negative norm that can be difficult to unwind.

The infant who cannot be vaccinated, for example, receives a positive externality from those who choose to vaccinate (less chance of getting the disease) and a negative externality from those who do not (more chance of getting the disease). Similarly, air pollution by a factory creates a negative externality for the people living nearby—low air quality. If that same company, though, trained all its workers in first aid, residents would receive a positive externality if some of those workers used that training to save lives outside of work.

Internalizing is an attempt to require the entity that causes the negative externality to pay for it. Ideally the “price” attached to the unwanted activity is high enough that it totally covers the cost of dealing with that activity’s consequences.

Another way to internalize externalities is through a marketplace. Ronald Coase won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1991 in part for what has become known as the Coase theorem, essentially a description of how a natural marketplace can internalize a negative externality.

The Coase theorem holds that instead of limiting the cows, another solution would have been to simply divide the grazing rights to the commons property among the farmers. The farmers could then trade the grazing rights among themselves, creating an efficient marketplace for the use of the commons

Governments have similarly tried to address the negative externalities from the burning of fossil fuels (e.g., climate change) through cap-and-trade systems, which are modern-day applications of the Coase theorem. The way these systems work is that the government requires emitters to hold permits for the amount of pollutants they emit. The government also sets a fixed number of total permits, which serves as the emission cap in the market, similar to the imposed limit on the number of cows that could graze on Boston Common.

Then companies can trade permits on an open exchange. Such a system satisfies the conditions of the Coase theorem because property rights are well defined through the permitting process, companies act rationally to maximize their profits, and the open market provides low transaction costs.

If you’re in charge of any system or policy, you want to think through the possible negative externalities ahead of time and devise ways to avoid them. What spillover effects could occur, and who would be affected by them? Is there a common resource that free riders could abuse or that could degrade into a tragedy of the commons? Is there another way to set up the policy or system that would reduce possible negative effects?

This phenomenon, known as moral hazard, is where you take on more risk, or hazard, once you have information that encourages you to believe you are more protected.

The problem arises when the agent takes on more risk than the principal would if the principal were acting alone, since the agent is more protected when things go wrong. For instance, when financial advisers manage your money, they try to stick to your risk profile, but they are more likely to take greater risks than you would on your own, simply because it isn’t their money, and so losses do not impact their net worth as much.

Agency can lead to other issues as well, collectively known as the principal-agent problem, where the self-interest of the agent may lead to suboptimal results for the principal across a wide variety of circumstances. Politicians don’t always act in the best interest of their constituents; real estate agents don’t always act in the best interest of their sellers; financial brokers don’t always act in the best interest of their clients; corporate management doesn’t always act in the best interest of its shareholders—you get the idea.

There was an individual mandate requiring health insurance, but the penalties for not complying were low, so the concern was that many healthy people would just opt to pay the fine rather than participate. Sick people, who need the insurance, would therefore make up more of the applicants, causing premiums to rise so that health insurers could cover their costs to care for them. This would, in turn, eject from the market more healthy participants not willing to pay these higher premiums, further raising prices. This situation is still unfolding, with those invested in the success of the ACA trying to ensure that it doesn’t spiral out of control

Sometimes there are ways to break the cycle. In the case of the used car market, services like Carfax try to restore symmetric information. This arrangement allows buyers to distinguish between lemons and peaches, and it eventually pushes lemons out of the market.

In contrast, one of the goals of the ACA was to make sure that people with preexisting conditions were not pushed out of the market. The only way this system works, though, is if healthy, lower-risk people continue paying into the system, allowing insurers to spread out the cost of higher-risk individuals.

The mental models from the last section (tragedy of the commons, externalities, etc.) and those from this section (moral hazard, information asymmetry, etc.) are signs of market failure, where open markets without intervention can create suboptimal results, or fail. To correct a market failure, an outside party must intervene in some way. Unfortunately, these interventions themselves can also fail, a result called government failure or political failure.

Antibiotics present a good case study in market and political failure. As we described earlier, overuse of antibiotics can reduce their efficacy as a common resource because bacteria have a chance of evolving to develop resistance each time an antibiotic is used. Overprescription of antibiotics therefore contributes to the negative externality of widespread antibiotic resistance

In some cases, as for bacterial ear infections, the expected value to the private market is actually negative, while the value to society is estimated to be approximately $500 billion!

If cloth was rewarded by the yard, it was woven loosely to make the yarn yield more yards. If the output of nails was determined by their number, factories produced huge numbers of pinlike nails; if by weight, smaller numbers of very heavy nails. The satiric magazine Krokodil once ran a cartoon of a factory manager proudly displaying his record output, a single gigantic nail suspended from a crane.

This model gets its name from a situation involving actual cobras. When the British were governing India, they were concerned about the number of these deadly snakes, and so they started offering a monetary reward for every snake brought to them. Initially the policy worked well, and the cobra population decreased. But soon, local entrepreneurs started breeding cobras just to collect the bounties. After the government found out and ended the policy, all the cobras that were being used for breeding were released, increasing the cobra population even further.

A similar thing happened under French rule of Vietnam. In Hanoi, the local government created a bounty program for rats, paying the bounty based on a rat’s tail. Enterprising ratcatchers, however, would catch and release the rats after just cutting off their tails; that way the rats could go back and reproduce. Whenever you create an incentive structure, you must heed Goodhart’s law and watch out for perverse incentives, lest you be overrun by cobras and rats!

The Streisand effect applies to an even more specific situation: when you unintentionally draw more attention to something when you try to hide it. It’s named for entertainer Barbra Streisand, who sued a photographer and website in 2003 for displaying an aerial photo of her mansion, which she wanted to remain private. Before the suit, the image had been downloaded a total of six times from the site; after people saw news stories about the lawsuit, the site was visited hundreds of thousands of times, and now the photo is free to license and is on display on Wikipedia and many other places. As was said of Watergate, It’s not the crime, it’s the cover-up.

When you shut down an internet site where people share illegal movies or music, more pop up in its place. Regime change in a country can result in an even worse regime.

With value-based care, by contrast, there is usually just one reimbursement payment amount for everything related to the surgery, including much of the directly related additional care. This payment scheme therefore incentivizes quality over quantity, as the healthcare provider conducting the surgery is also on the hook for some of the additional care, sometimes even if it is administered by other providers. This payment scheme therefore focuses healthcare providers on determining the exact right amount of treatment because they face financial consequences for over- or under-providing care.

The idea is to make choices that preserve future options. Maybe as a business you put some excess profits into a rainy-day fund, or as an employee you dedicate some time to learning new skills that might give you options for future employment. Or, when faced with a decision, maybe you can delay deciding at all (see thinking gray in Chapter 1) and, instead, continue to wait for more information, keeping your options open until you are more certain of a better path to embark upon.

The downside of keeping many options open is that it often requires more resources, increasing costs. Think of going to school while you also have a full-time job, maintaining multiple homes, or exploring several lines of business in one parent company. You need to find the right balance between preserving optionality and path dependence.

One model that can help you figure out how to strike this balance in certain situations is the precautionary principle: when an action could possibly create harm of an unknown magnitude, you should proceed with extreme caution before enacting the policy. It’s like the medical principle of “First, do no harm.”

In 2012, the European Union adopted the precautionary principle formally with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: Union policy on the environment shall aim at a high level of protection taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Union. It shall be based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay.

On an individual level, the precautionary principle instructs you to take pause when an action could possibly cause you significant personal harm. That seems obvious, but people engage in risky behavior all the time (e.g., drunk or reckless driving). Beyond physical harm, the same concept applies to other kinds of harm: for example, financial harm (gambling or accepting a bad loan) and emotional harm (infidelity or going too far in an argument).

There is a natural conflict between the desire to make decisions quickly and the feeling that you need to accumulate more information to be sure you are making the right choice. You can deal with this conflict by categorizing decisions as either reversible decisions or irreversible decisions.

Irreversible decisions are hard if not impossible to unwind. And they tend to be really important. Think of selling your business or having a kid. This model holds that these decisions require a different decision-making process than their reversible counterparts, which should be treated much more fluidly.

Jeff Bezos stressed the importance of this model: Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible—one-way doors—and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. . . . But most decisions aren’t like that—they are changeable, reversible—they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal [reversible] decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. . . . As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight [irreversible] decision-making process on most decisions, including many [reversible] decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention.

early 1950s, psychologists William Hick and Ray Hyman separately conducted a number of experiments to try to quantify the mathematical relationship between the number of choices given and how long it takes to decide. They found that a greater number of choices increased the decision time logarithmically, in a formulation now known as Hick’s law.

In any situation where you can spot spillover effects (like a polluting factory), look for an externality (like bad health effects) lurking nearby. Fixing it will require intervention either by fiat (like government regulation) or by setting up a marketplace system according to the Coase theorem (like cap and trade). Public goods (like education) are particularly susceptible to the tragedy of the commons (like poor schools) via the free rider problem (like not paying taxes). Beware of situations with asymmetric information, as they can lead to principal-agent problems. Be careful when basing rewards on measurable incentives, because you are likely to cause unintended and undesirable behavior (Goodhart’s law). Short-termism can easily lead to the accumulation of technical debt and create disadvantageous path dependence; to counteract it, think about preserving optionality and keep in mind the precautionary principle. Internalize the distinction between irreversible and reversible decisions, and don’t let yourself succumb to analysis paralysis for the latter. Heed Murphy’s law!

Everyone who’s worked on difficult problems is probably familiar with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing, and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something else. There’s a kind of thinking you do without trying to. I’m increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful in solving hard problems, but necessary. The tricky part is, you can only control it indirectly. I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given time. That’s the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they’re allowed to drift freely. And this idea will thus tend to get all the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of it. Which means it’s a disaster to let the wrong idea become the top one in your mind.

In a November 6, 2014, lecture titled “How to Operate,” entrepreneur and investor Keith Rabois tells a story about how Peter Thiel used this concept when he was CEO of PayPal: [Peter] used to insist at PayPal that every single person could only do exactly one thing. And we all rebelled, every single person in the company rebelled to this idea. Because it’s so unnatural, it’s so different than other companies where people wanted to do multiple things, especially as you get more senior, you definitely want to do more things and you feel insulted to be asked to do just one thing. Peter would enforce this pretty strictly. He would say, I will not talk to you about anything else besides this one thing I assigned you. I don’t want to hear about how great you are doing over here, just shut up, and Peter would run away. . . . The insight behind this is that most people will solve problems that they understand how to solve. Roughly speaking, they will solve B+ problems instead of A+ problems. A+ problems are high-impact problems for your company, but they are difficult. You don’t wake up in the morning with a solution, so you tend to procrastinate them. So imagine you wake up in the morning and create a list of things to do today, there’s usually the A+ one on the top of the list, but you never get around to it. And so you solve the second and third. Then you have a company of over a hundred people, so it cascades. You have a company that is always solving B+ things, which does mean you grow, which does mean you add value, but you never really create that breakthrough idea. No one is spending 100% of their time banging their head against the wall every day until they solve it.

You should focus your creative energies on these quadrant II activities as much as possible, because working on them will drive you fastest toward your long-term goals.

The essential insight to be gained from this matrix is that the important activities in quadrant II are often overshadowed by the urgent distractions in quadrant III. You can be tricked into addressing the tasks in quadrant III immediately because they have urgency, vying for your attention. However, if you let those distractions in quadrant III take up a lot of your time, you may never get to the important tasks in quadrant II

It would be unhealthy to get rid of leisure completely in your life, but it is essential to evaluate how much of your time is being spent on leisure and unimportant activities so that they don’t get in the way of achieving your long-term goals.

Quadrant IV activities also have the capacity to present with false urgency (like most email and texts). If you let them consistently interrupt you, you will suffer the negative effects of multitasking, context-switching between quadrant II and IV activities, significantly decreasing your performance on important matters. One approach to counteract this effect is to turn off notifications so that you do not succumb to this false urgency

In the budget meeting, the agenda could instead be structured so that time is pre-allocated proportionally to the relative importance of each item, and items can also be ordered by importance. That way much greater time will be apportioned to the reactor relative to the bike shed, and the reactor discussion will take place first. You can further set strict time limits for each agenda item (called timeboxing) to ensure that any bike-shedding that does arise doesn’t take over the entire meeting.

For a real-life example, consider the recurring prominent debates about small items in the national budget each year in the United States. In the name of balancing the budget, politicians perennially suggest cutting national arts funding, science funding, and foreign aid. No matter what you personally think of these programs, cutting them substantially will not significantly reduce the budget, as they respectively amount only to approximately 0.01 percent, 0.2 percent, and 1.3 percent of the total budget. In other words, if your goal is to significantly cut the budget, you would need to focus on much more major items in the budget. The sound and fury you hear over these relatively small items is therefore either a distraction from making any substantive progress on the stated goal or a misleading use of the idea of overall budget cuts to attack these programs for an unstated goal (like getting the federal government out of the business of funding these types of programs altogether).

Everyone discounts the future as compared with the present to some degree. For instance, given a choice between getting $100 today and $100 in a year, most everyone would choose to get it today. Suppose, though, you’re offered $100 in a year, but you can pay a fee to get the $100 today (minus the fee). How much would you be willing to pay? Would you pay $20 to get the $100 right now (netting $80) versus getting $100 in a year? When you cast this fee as a percentage, it effectively becomes an “interest rate,” called the discount rate (in the example above, it would be 25 percent, since $80 × 125% = $100). Like any interest rate, it can compound, but instead of compounding positively as we discussed earlier, the discount rate compounds negatively. This negative compounding discounts payments out into the future more and more, since you won’t be able to access them until much later. The discount rate is the cornerstone of the discounted cash flow method of valuing assets, investments, and offers. This model can help you properly determine the worth of arrangements that involve future payments, such as investment properties, stocks, and bonds. For example, let’s say you win the lottery and are offered a choice between getting one million dollars each year, forever, or a lump-sum payment today. How high does that lump-sum payment need to be before you will accept it? You might think initially it should be exceptionally high because the payments go out forever; but because of the compounding discount rate, the expected earnings far in the future aren’t actually worth that much to you today.

Tom Cargill was credited (in the September 1985 Communications of the ACM) for the similar ninety-ninety rule from his time programming at Bell Labs in the 1980s: The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time.

Choose activities to work on based on their relevance to your north star. Focus your time on just one of these truly important activities at a time (no multitasking!), making it the top idea on your mind. Select between options based on opportunity cost models. Use the Pareto principle to find the 80/20 in any activity and increase your leverage at every turn. Recognize when you’ve hit diminishing returns and avoid negative returns. Use commitment and the default effect to avoid present bias, and periodic evaluations to avoid loss aversion and the sunk-cost fallacy.

Organizations face a similar danger because of inertia. A long-term commitment to an organizational strategy creates a lot of inertia toward that strategy. This inertia can lead to suboptimal decisions, referred to as a strategy tax

Google’s strategy of being the world’s biggest advertising company requires it to pay the tax of not adding significant anti-tracking features to its browser, since doing so would counteract that strategy. Apple does not have to pay this tax since it does not have such a strategy.

Reversing course once a strategy tax is established can be even more costly. In 1988, George H. W. Bush delivered this famous line at the Republican Party’s national convention: “Read my lips: no new taxes.” Later, this commitment caused significant problems for him when he faced a recession as president. Ultimately, Bush decided he had to break his pledge and raise taxes, and it cost him reelection.

Sometimes a person or department will try to preserve an inefficient process, even when a new idea or technology comes around that can make things easier. Think of the stodgy person at your office or school who is always talking about the “way it’s always been done,” constantly anxious about change and new technology. That person embodies the Shirky principle. You do not want to be that person.

This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not “aging” like persons, but “aging” in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. This is an indicator of some robustness. The robustness of an item is proportional to its life! The Lindy effect applies to technologies, ideas, organizations, and other nonperishable things. Assuming that the thing in question is not falling out of favor, the longer it endures, the longer you can expect it to further endure. The Lindy effect explains the continued relevance of Shakespeare and the Beatles. Since they show no signs of falling out of favor, the Lindy effect tells us we can expect Shakespeare plays to be performed for at least another four hundred years, and Beatles songs to be heard for at least another fifty. Of course, things can and do eventually become unpopular, and there is another mental model to describe the point at which something’s relevance begins to decline. This model is peak, as in peak sexism, peak Facebook. This concept was actually popularized with oil, as peak oil is usually defined as the point in time when the maximum amount of oil is being extracted from Earth. After peak oil, the decline may be a slow one, but it will have begun, with oil production falling each year instead of rising.

Momentum is a model that can help you understand how things change. Momentum and inertia are related concepts. In physics, momentum is the product (multiplication) of mass and velocity, whereas inertia is just a function of mass. That means a heavy object at rest has a lot of inertia since it is hard to move, but it has no momentum since its velocity is zero. However, a heavy object gets momentum quickly once it starts moving. The faster an object goes, the more momentum it has. However, its inertia remains the same (since its mass remains the same), and it is still similarly difficult to change its velocity.

For example, in 2013 the U.S. government embarked on a strategy to create a website where citizens could directly apply for healthcare coverage. The website, HealthCare.gov, was to be made available on October 1, 2013, though unlike major technology firms, the U.S. government does not have a culture attuned to creating mainstream websites on a deadline. This culture/strategy mismatch was obvious when the government botched the launch of HealthCare.gov. In the first week of operations, only a small percentage of those interested were able to enroll. A strike team was assembled to fix the website, filled with top talent from major tech firms, a group steeped in a culture better matched to this strategy.

Playskool had a branded version called a Weeble—“Weebles wobble, but they don’t fall down”), which rights itself when pushed over. These toys work using two useful concepts that are also metaphorical mental models that help you when enacting change: potential energy and center of gravity. Potential energy is the stored energy of an object, which has the potential to be released. Center of gravity is the center point in an object or system around which its mass is balanced.

In 2017, the U.S. saw both a rapid takedown of statues commemorating Confederate leaders and the accelerating takedown of sexual predators via the #MeToo movement. In both cases it seems that once there was enough activation energy, the movements pushed forward very quickly. It turns out there was a lot of potential energy waiting to be unleashed once those first steps were taken. Furthermore, social media posts and reporting by journalists were catalysts, serving as both a blueprint and an outlet for others to publicize these causes.

The design of this book is based on five core beliefs: 1. I believe most books are longer than they need to be. 2. I believe most books are more complicated than they need to be. 3. I believe pictures paint a thousand words. 4. I believe stories are more powerful than data, but both are important. 5. I believe in nuance and that the truth is often somewhere in the middle. In short, it aims to embody a quote often attributed to Einstein: ‘Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.’

THE FOUR PILLARS OF GREATNESS Becoming great, and building great things, requires mastery within four pillars. I call these the four pillars of greatness. PILLAR I: THE SELF As Leonardo da Vinci asserted, ‘One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself; you will never have a greater or lesser dominion than that over yourself; the height of your success is gauged by your self-mastery, the depth of your failure by your self-abandonment. Those who cannot establish dominion over themselves will have no dominion over others.’ This pillar is about you. Your self-awareness, self-control, self-care, self-conduct, self-esteem and self-story. The self is the only thing we have direct control over; to master it, which is no easy task, is to master your entire world. PILLAR II: THE STORY Everything that stands in your way is a human. Science, psychology and history have shown that there is no graph, data or information that stands a greater chance of positively influencing those humans than a truly great story. Stories are the single most powerful weapon any leader can arm themselves with – they are the currency of humanity. Those who tell captivating, inspiring, emotional stories rule the world. This pillar is about storytelling and how to harness the laws of storytelling to persuade the humans that stand in your way to follow you, to buy from you, to believe you, to trust you, to click, to act, to hear you and to understand you. PILLAR III: THE PHILOSOPHY In business, sports and academia, an individual’s personal philosophies are the single biggest predictors of how they’ll behave, now and in the future – if you know someone’s philosophy or beliefs, you can accurately forecast how they’ll behave in any situation. This pillar is about the personal and professional philosophies that great people believe and live by and how those philosophies result in behaviour that leads to greatness. Your philosophy is the set of beliefs, values or principles that guide your behaviour – they are the fundamental beliefs that underpin your actions. PILLAR IV: THE TEAM The definition of the word ‘company’ is ‘group of people’; at its essence, every company, project or organisation is just a group of people. Everything the organisation produces, good or bad, originates from the minds of the members of your group of people. The most important success factor in your work is who you choose to work with. I’ve never seen anyone build a great company, project or organisation without a group of people, and I’ve never seen anyone reach personal greatness without the support of a group of people. This pillar is about how to assemble and get the best out of your group of people. Assembling any group of people is not enough; for your group of people to become a truly great team, you need the right people, bound together by the right culture. When you have great people bound by a great culture, the whole team becomes greater than the sum of its parts. When 1 + 1 = 3, great things happen.

critical mass is the mass of nuclear material needed to create a nuclear chain reaction, where the by-products of one reaction are used as the inputs for the next, chaining them together in a self-perpetuating fashion. Nuclear Chain Reaction This piece of knowledge was essential for the creation of the atomic bomb. Below the critical mass, nuclear elements are relatively harmless; above, and you have enough material to drive an atomic explosion.

Austrian-British physicist Otto Frisch was tasked with determining how much enriched uranium was required to create the critical mass for the first atomic bomb. Believe it or not, Frisch figured out the critical mass in part by physically stacking three-centimeter uranium bars, continually measuring their radioactive output as the stack grew larger. One day he almost caused a runaway reaction, the first known criticality accident, by simply leaning over the stack with his body. Some of the radiation reflected off his body and back into the stack, already near the critical mass, causing the radiation-detecting red lamps in the vicinity to shine continuously instead of flickering intermittently as usual. Noticing the lamps, Frisch scattered some of the bars quickly with his hand, and later wrote in his memoir, What Little I Remember, that if he “had hesitated for another two seconds before removing the material . . . the dose would have been fatal

Reaching a critical mass is a common proximate cause (see Chapter 1) of a tipping point. But the root cause of why a tipping point has been reached is often found in network effects, where the value of a network grows with each addition to it (the effect).

This relationship, known as Metcalfe’s law, is named after Robert Metcalfe, the co-inventor of the networking technology Ethernet. It describes the nonlinear growth in network value when nodes are connected to one another. His law oversimplifies reality since it assumes that every node (or telephone in this case) has the same value to the network and that every node may want to contact every other, but nevertheless it serves as a decent model.

Critical mass occurs when there are enough nodes present to make a network useful. Amazingly, the fax machine was invented in the 1840s, but people didn’t regularly use it until the 1970s, when there were enough fax machines to reach critical mass. The modern equivalent is internet messaging services: they need to reach critical mass within a community to be useful. Once they pass this tipping point, they can rapidly make their way into the mainstream.

Network effects have value beyond communication, however. Many modern systems gain network effects by simply being able to process more data. For example, speech recognition improves when more voices are added. Other systems gain advantages by being able to provide more liquidity or selection based on the volume or breadth of participants. Think of how more goods are available on Etsy and eBay when more people are participating on those sites.

When discovering the atomic critical mass, Otto Frisch narrowly avoided a catastrophic chain reaction, known more generally as a cascading failure, where a failure in one piece of a system can trigger a chain reaction of failure that cascades through the entire system. Major blackouts on our electric grid are usually the result of cascading failure: overload in one area triggers overload in adjacent areas, triggering further overload in more adjacent areas, and so on

Your luck surface area relates to the natural concept of entropy, which measures the amount of disorder in a system. In a clean room where there is a rule for where everything goes—socks in the sock drawer, shirts on hangers, etc.—there are not many possible configurations for everything in the room because of these strict rules. The maximum amount of entropy in this arrangement is small. If you relax those rules, for example by allowing clothes to go on the floor, there are suddenly many more possible configurations for everything in the room. The amount of possible disorderliness, the maximum entropy level possible for the room, has gone up significantly.

He is amazed at the shooter’s accuracy, only to find that the targets were drawn around the bullet holes after the shots were fired. A similar concept is the moving target, where the goal of an experiment is changed to support a desired outcome after seeing the results.

One of the hardest things about designing a solid experiment is defining its endpoint, the metric that is used to evaluate the hypothesis. Ideally, the endpoint is an objective metric, something that can be easily measured and consistently interpreted. Some examples of objective metrics include whether someone bought a product, is still alive, or clicked a button on a website. However, when the concept that researchers are interested in studying isn’t clearly observable or measurable, they must use a proxy endpoint (also called a surrogate endpoint or marker), a measure expected to be closely correlated to the endpoint they would measure if they could. A proxy essentially means a stand-in for something else. Other uses of this mental model include the proxy vote (e.g., absentee ballot) and proxy war (e.g., current conflicts in Yemen and Syria are a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia). While there is no one objective measure of the quality of a university, every year U.S. News and World Report tries to rank schools against one another using a proxy metric that is a composite of objective measures, such as graduation rates and admission data, along with more subjective measures, such as academic reputation. Other examples of common proxy metrics include the

With selection bias, there is no guarantee that the study has isolated smoking to be the only difference between these groups. So if there is a difference detected at the end of the study, it cannot be easily determined how much smoking contributed to this difference. For instance, women who choose to continue smoking during their pregnancy against the advice of doctors may similarly make other medically questionable choices, which could drive adverse outcomes. Selection bias can also occur when a sample is selected that is not representative of the broader population of interest, as with online reviews. If the group studied isn’t representative, then the results may not be applicable overall.

A similar selection bias occurs with parents and school choice for their kids. Parents understandably want to give their kids a leg up and will often move or pay to send their kids to “better schools.” However, is the school better because there are better teachers or because the students are better prepared due to their parents’ financial means and interest in education? Selection bias likely explains some significant portion of these schools’ better test scores and college admissions.

Most media reports don’t mention the confidence level used to calculate their margin of error, but it is usually safe to assume they used 95 percent. Research publications, by contrast, are usually more explicit in stating what confidence levels they used to represent the uncertainty in their estimates (again typically, though not always, 95 percent).

The normal distribution is particularly useful in experimental analysis due to the central limit theorem. Recall that in a normal distribution, about 68 percent of values fall within one standard deviation, and 95 percent within two. Any isolated experiment can result in a false positive or a false negative and can also be biased by myriad factors, most commonly selection bias, response bias, and survivorship bias.

You’ve probably heard the phrase If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. This phrase is called Maslow’s hammer and is derived from this longer passage by psychologist Abraham Maslow in his 1966 book The Psychology of Science: I remember seeing an elaborate and complicated automatic washing machine for automobiles that did a beautiful job of washing them. But it could do only that, and everything else that got into its clutches was treated as if it were an automobile to be washed. I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.

These five buckets are interconnected – filling one helps to fill another – and they are generally filled in order from left to right. We usually start our professional life acquiring knowledge (school, university, etc.), and when this knowledge is applied, we call it a skill. When you have knowledge and skills you become professionally valuable to others and your network grows. Consequently, when you have knowledge, skills and a network, your access to resources expands, and once you have knowledge, skills, a valuable network and resources, you will undoubtedly earn a reputation.

Our ego has an incredible ability to persuade us to skip the first two buckets – convincing us to take a job simply for more money (bucket 4) or a job title, status or reputation (bucket 5), without the knowledge (bucket 1) or skills (bucket 2) to succeed in that role.

Asking someone to explain the detail and logic underpinning their strongly held beliefs is a profoundly powerful way to reduce their conviction. This works for limiting beliefs too. If someone is struggling with their self-belief and believes they’re worthless, having them explain in as much detail as they can, why they feel that way, and questioning their responses, is an effective way to get them to relinquish that belief.

Developing a healthier relationship to work is not as simple as quitting your job or taking up knitting. Not everyone has the ability to dictate their hours or choose their profession.

Being a smoker, for example, is dissonant – it conflicts with the evidence that smoking is incredibly harmful. To resolve this tension, the smoker must either give up or find a way to justify their behaviour.

How on earth did a company with such a long history of being nothing special transform itself into an enterprise that outperformed some of the best-led organizations in the world? And why was Walgreens able to make the leap when other companies in the same industry with the same opportunities and similar resources, such as Eckerd, did not make the leap? This single case captures the essence of our quest.

Every time a reader encounters a written communication—even something as short as an email, a text, a Slack message, or a social media post—they go through a four-stage process: First, they must decide whether to engage with it at all. Second, if they decide to engage, they then must decide when to engage. Sometimes the decision to engage leads to a decision to engage later. Third, once they do engage, they must decide how much time and attention to allocate to reading the message. Fourth, if they read something that requires a response, they must decide whether to respond or react.

Decision researchers call these mental shortcuts “heuristics,” but for simplicity, we’ll call them “rules of thumb.” One common rule of thumb is that, when faced with a lot of options, we pick the first one that seems good enough (sometimes called “satisficing”), rather than expending the effort to seek out the absolute best measured option.

One way or another, almost all writers will face a trade-off between reaching more readers using fewer ideas or fewer readers using more ideas. There are no universal rules for how many ideas are too many or for which ideas are important to keep, but there is the same standby principle: Cut as much as possible within your specific context. As with words, more ideas can both deter readers from engaging and decrease the chance that readers will grasp key information if they do engage.

Since Behavioral Scientist is run by (you guessed it) behavioral scientists, they decided to test whether removing the lower-priority request from the email would increase engagement with their higher-priority request: getting readers to click on the link to learn more about the current issue. Presenting just a single link in the email resulted in 50% more clicks on that link. Putting in a second link may have seemed like a “bonus” that would drive more reader engagement, but it had the opposite effect. Including a second link, to the past issue, diverted readers from the most important request, sharply reducing the likelihood that they performed it at all.

Readability measures are represented as single quantitative scores, or as the academic grade level a reader would have needed to complete to be expected to comprehend the text (based on the US system). For example, The New York Times is written at an eleventh-grade reading level, while most nursery rhymes are written at a fourth-grade reading level. Using short and familiar words, short sentences, simple sentence structure, and active voice can improve understanding by lowering the required reading level.

Some professional fields have developed specialized vocabularies for talking precisely about concepts that nonspecialists don’t need to talk about. In other contexts, writing complexity may be used as a rule of thumb for assessing the competence and intelligence of the writer. This can be particularly consequential in cases where there is a power dynamic between the reader and the writer. Writers who are relatively low-status (for example, in terms of professional rank or social status) may risk being seen as less intelligent if they write simply, whereas higher-status writers may get applauded for being plainspoken.

The scholarly paper reporting this finding was amusingly titled “Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly.”[28] It showed that college students rated writers who used complex language to be less intelligent than writers who used simpler language. This paper won the 2006 Ig Nobel Prize for Literature, a prize given to “honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think.”

Humans evolved to speak and listen, long before we developed the ability to read and write. Because we tend to converse in incomplete, short sentences, our brains evolved to make these types of linguistic structures easy to understand. Long, complete sentences are relatively unusual in spoken language, so they challenge our limited mental abilities.

It’s generally easier to read two ten-word sentences than one twenty-word sentence. That may be one reason why the average length of written sentences has decreased over the years.[33] Novels published in 1800 averaged twenty-seven words per sentence, whereas those published in 2000 averaged just ten words per sentence.[34] In case you were wondering, the decrease in sentence length doesn’t mean we have become less intelligent. On the contrary, numerous studies have found rising IQ scores around the globe, a phenomenon known as the Flynn effect.

Inaugural addresses delivered by US presidents have similarly incorporated shorter sentences over time. The first five sentences of President George Washington’s address in 1789 averaged sixty-four words, whereas the first five sentences of President Joseph Biden’s in 2021 averaged a mere seven words. We’re not cherry-picking the data. Nearly everywhere we look, we see a gradual but consistent decline in sentence length.

The US Army has codified this advice with a guideline that writers should place the bottom line up front (BLUF).[1] BLUF is an official army policy instructing writers to put the key information at the beginning of written communications

Effective writing, by definition, relies on words, sentences, and paragraphs to convey ideas. But effective communication doesn’t have to abide by that constraint.

Perhaps because of these ambiguities, all-caps use has been a subject of legal deliberation. The US Federal Trade Commission requires that consumer disclosures (such as legal terms and conditions) be “clear and conspicuous.”[3] To satisfy the requirement, many organizations use all caps in critical sections of contracts; for instance, more than three-quarters of the terms-and-conditions contracts for Amazon, Uber, and Facebook contain at least one all-caps paragraph.

as knowledge is prerequisite to understanding, that is all to the good. But knowledge is not as much a prerequisite to understanding as is commonly supposed. We do not have to know everything about something in order to understand it; too many facts are often as much of an obstacle to understanding as too few. There is a sense in which we moderns are inundated with facts to the detriment of understanding.

We writers tend to be similarly terrible at taking our readers’ perspective. We think they devote more time to our messages than they do. We think that they find value in the same things that we do.

And the pressures to work more effectively and efficiently are only going to increase. Businesses have spent the last twenty years focusing on process and technology improvements, and on cost cutting, and by now there’s not much left to cut. For the next ten (or fifty) years, breakthrough performance is going to depend instead on people learning to deal with conflict more effectively and, indeed, leveraging it for competitive advantage. Ideally, conflict and differing perspectives, handled well and efficiently, should become a competitive asset — an engine for rapid learning and innovation.

What I would do is, at the start of every year in school, all the children would be given a business and told to make it grow. We would help kids monetize it in their break, and they would be taught how to negotiate, how to talk, how to sell, how to not sell. This way, they will learn that people sell and do everything possible to make their business grow to get ahead in life; it’s not only about marks.

everybody would get a platform to learn communication, learn negotiation, learn selling, learn how to source things, to sell things, how to identify the target audience. They would learn whom to hang out with, whom not to hang out with. They would learn to identify who is a potential paying customer and who is going to turn into a bad debt. They will basically understand people, understand themselves, understand their business model, understand sourcing and selling—all of it just in a small short break.

Schools give us a certificate of participation, but life mein ghanta milta hai participation ka. In life, you either win or you lose. Nobody is going to hand you a candy in the real world, saying, ‘Oh, my God! You participated! Here, take a part of the profits too.’ No! You either get the business deal or you don’t. Investors won’t put money in your business just because you were present in a room full of start-ups.

I don’t understand equality. Life is not equal. Life is brutal. I think if, as kids, everybody was made to understand that the world is an unfair place, the way we live and the way we think would be so much better. Because of two things: number one, you know the world will trample you the first chance it gets, so you will always be prepared and work harder. Number two, you will always try to make this world a better place because it is a brutal world. But no, we are taught the opposite. We are taught that this world is a fairyland. That’s why we never try to make the world a better place. We think, ‘Oh, maybe there is something wrong with me or the people around me are stupid.’

We think that if only we could get out of this current place and be around different people, things would be better. So you move to a bigger city, only to realize that people here are worse.

In theoretical terms, governance is the process of governing. It is what governments do to their citizens. But it is also what corporations and other organizations do to their employees and members. Further, the process of governing need not be consciously undertaken by a hierarchically organized set of actors. Markets and networks of actors can govern, produce coordination, and make decisions. Whereas government refers to political institutions, governance refers to processes of rule wherever they occur.

But when you think of the company as a product, you ask different questions: Do people who work here know how to use the company? Is it simple? Complex? Is it obvious how it works? What’s fast about it? What’s slow about it? Are there bugs? What’s broken that we can fix quickly and what’s going to take a long time?

We work on projects for six weeks at a time, then we take two weeks off from scheduled work to roam and decompress. We didn’t simply theorize that would be the best way to work. We started by working on things for as long as they took. Then we saw how projects never seemed to end. So we started time-boxing at three months. We found that was still too long. So we tried even shorter times. And we ended up here, in six-week cycles. We iterated our way to what works for us. We’ll talk all about this in the book.

In one study, researchers varied the messenger of letters aimed at encouraging low-income Californians to check their eligibility for and claim the Earned Income Tax Credit.[8] Half the recipients got a letter from the Franchise Tax Board, the California state agency that administers and collects taxes. The other half received a letter from Golden State Opportunity, a California-based nonprofit organization. Both letters directed recipients to a website where they could check their eligibility for the tax credit. People who received the letter from the Franchise Tax Board were three times as likely as those who received the Golden State Opportunity letter to visit the website, probably because the Franchise Tax Board is more well-known and seen as more credible.

The smarter you are, the more complex the problems you can solve—and the faster you can solve them. Intelligence is traditionally viewed as the ability to think and learn. Yet in a turbulent world, there’s another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn.

Mantra-type meditation may provide more direct practice in building focus, although effects generally become apparent after weeks or months. Open monitoring–type meditation may help cognition indirectly, by improving mood. A challenge is that many past studies on meditation didn’t follow proper scientific procedures, so more research is needed.

KEY TAKEAWAYS 
FROM THE CHAPTER The Pomodoro Technique is one of the most powerful methods for tackling procrastination. To do it:  –   Remove distractions. –   Set a timer for 25 minutes. –   Focus as intently as you can for those 25 minutes. –   Reward yourself. Take a 5-minute or so mental break. (Use a timer for the break if necessary.) –   Do another Pomodoro until the work—or you!—is done. A pain in the brain can trigger procrastination. Be aware of minor feelings of discomfort when you think about something you don’t like to do—these feelings can trigger procrastination. That pain in the brain dissipates once you get started. In general, it’s best to avoid multitasking. But multitasking is not all bad—it can sometimes help you avoid becoming fixed on a cognitive approach that’s going nowhere. Set up a distraction-free environment. Do a sweep through the notifications settings on your devices and disable audible, visible, and vibrating alerts. Keep your phone out of reach. If you are called off-task by someone or something, try to take mental note of where you were so you can more easily return to it. Take frequent brief breaks. If you go too long on any one task, you will inevitably tire. If you like to listen to music when you’re working, make sure it isn’t distracting your attention. Think twice about listening to music while studying unless you’re already learning the material well.

Writing an overly stiff email to a close colleague or friend, for instance, is likely to come across as strange or rude. But writing an overly informal email to a person in a position of power may also come across as rude. In both cases, readers may be deterred from responding because of what the communication style signals.

Empirical evidence shows that firms write more obtusely when disclosing to investors CEO compensation packages and other critical financial matters,[15] and scientists write more complexly when their research is fraudulent.[16] Sometimes writers are paid to spread misleading ideas and outright lies on behalf of corporations, politicians, governments, advocacy groups, and other organizations. Such writers are distressingly common on social media, though propaganda and disinformation are hardly modern inventions.

Here’s how each essentially functions: 1. The emotion default: we tend to respond to feelings rather than reasons and facts. 2. The ego default: we tend to react to anything that threatens our sense of self-worth or our position in a group hierarchy. 3. The social default: we tend to conform to the norms of our larger social group. 4. The inertia default: we’re habit forming and comfort seeking. We tend to resist change, and to prefer ideas, processes, and environments that are familiar.

second main factor that spawns new economic fallacies every day. This is the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.

The group that would benefit by such policies, having such a direct interest in them, will argue for them plausibly and persistently. It will hire the best buyable minds to devote their whole time to presenting its case. And it will finally either convince the general public that its case is sound, or so befuddle it that clear thinking on the subject becomes next to impossible.

Nine-tenths of the economic fallacies that are working such dreadful harm in the world today are the result of ignoring this lesson. Those fallacies all stem from one of two central fallacies, or both: that of looking only at the immediate consequences of an act or proposal, and that of looking at the consequences only for a particular group to the neglect of other groups.

The glazier’s gain of business, in short, is merely the tailor’s loss of business. No new “employment” has been added. The people in the crowd were thinking only of two parties to the transaction, the baker and the glazier. They had forgotten the potential third party involved, the tailor. They forgot him precisely because he will not now enter the scene. They will see the new window in the next day or two. They will never see the extra suit, precisely because it will never be made. They see only what is immediately visible to the eye.

Most interesting of all, unlike the vast majority of firms that fail when the industry shifts, Netflix had responded successfully to four massive transitions in the entertainment and business environment in just fifteen years: From DVD by mail to streaming old TV series and movies over the internet. From streaming old content to launching new original content (such as House of Cards) produced by external studios. From licensing content provided by external studios to building their own in-house studio that creates award-winning TV shows and movies (such as Stranger Things, La Casa De Papel, and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs). From a USA-only company to a global company entertaining people in 190 countries.

Increase candor. Talented employees have an enormous amount to learn from one another. But the normal polite human protocols often prevent employees from providing the feedback necessary to take performance to another level. When talented staff members get into the feedback habit, they all get better at what they do while becoming implicitly accountable to one another, further reducing the need for traditional controls.

Reduce controls. Start by ripping pages from the employee handbook. Travel policies, expense policies, vacation policies—these can all go. Later, as talent becomes increasingly denser and feedback more frequent and candid, you can remove approval processes throughout the organization, teaching your managers principles like, “Lead with context, not control,” and coaching your employees using such guidelines as, “Don’t seek to please your boss.”

In February 2015, I read an article in the Huffington Post titled, “One Reason for Netflix’s Success—It Treats Employees Like Grownups.” The article explained: Netflix assumes that you have amazing judgment, . . . .

The flip side . . . is that people are expected to work at a super-high level or be quickly shown the door (with a generous severance package).

Blockbuster made most of its margin from late fees. If your business model depends on inducing feelings of stupidity in your customer base, you can hardly expect to build much loyalty.

If you have a team of five stunning employees and two adequate ones, the adequate ones will sap managers’ energy, so they have less time for the top performers, reduce the quality of group discussions, lowering the team’s overall IQ, force others to develop ways to work around them, reducing efficiency, drive staff who seek excellence to quit, and show the team you accept mediocrity, thus multiplying the problem.

For top performers, a great workplace isn’t about a lavish office, a beautiful gym, or a free sushi lunch. It’s about the joy of being surrounded by people who are both talented and collaborative. People who can help you be better. When every member is excellent, performance spirals upward as employees learn from and motivate one another.

THE FIRST DOT This is the most critical dot for the foundation of the whole Netflix story. A fast and innovative workplace is made up of what we call “stunning colleagues”—highly talented people, of diverse backgrounds and perspectives, who are exceptionally creative, accomplish significant amounts of important work, and collaborate effectively. What’s more, none of the other principles can work unless you have ensured this first dot is in place.

In my first few years as CEO at Pure Software, I managed the technology well. But I was still pretty miserable at the people part of leadership. I was conflict-avoidant. People would become upset if I addressed them directly with a problem, so I would try to work around issues when they arose.

Leslie spoke to Barry the next day and did a much better job than I ever could. She found a way to calculate how much money his moodiness was costing the business. She spoke to him in his own financial language, adding a shot of her infectious humor to the communication, and Barry was moved. He went back to his team, told them about the feedback he’d received, and asked them to call him out when his mood was influencing their actions.

You’ve probably experienced moments like these. You may not always remain silent. But often you do—and when you do, it’s likely to be because of one of the following reasons: You think your viewpoint won’t be supported. You don’t want to be viewed as “difficult.” You don’t want to get into an unpleasant argument. You don’t want to risk upsetting or angering your colleagues. You’re wary of being called “not a team player.”
